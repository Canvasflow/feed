<![CDATA[ Bray makes hay to move to Ryan Motorsport Insurance Autosport National Rankings summit ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>It is all change at the top of the Ryan Motorsport Insurance Autosport National Rankings this week as Ali Bray takes over at the head of a radically altered leaderboard.</p><p>Alongside Bray jumping up from second to first, there are four new drivers inside the top 10, while another has moved further up the table after a busy weekend of club motorsport that featured nine race meetings across the UK.</p><p>Bray is best known as an ace Mazda MX-5 preparer but has been behind the wheel himself in the British Racing &amp; Sports Car Club's Mk1 MX-5 Championship this year and continued his unbeaten start to the season at Snetterton last weekend, where he bagged another hat-trick.</p><p>Those successes have taken his 2025 tally to nine wins already and he is now two clear of previous table-topper Steve Gambrell.</p><p>Another driver to move towards the summit is Hillman Imp star James Ibbotson. He picked up another three Pre-'66 Touring Car class triumphs at Pembrey to take his total to seven wins and leap from 22nd to third.</p><p>Two other MX-5 frontrunners have also been on the march this week. Aidan Hills picked up a Miata Trophy victory at Brands Hatch in his Mk3 to climb from fifth to fourth.</p><p>However, the cancellation of the second race amid barrier damage from an earlier GT Cup clash cost him the chance of progressing further.</p><p>Rounding out the Mazda maestros making notable gains is Will Blackwell-Chambers, who topped all three MX-5 Supercup contests at Snetterton to rocket up from joint 46th to sixth.</p><p>Sandwiched between the MX-5 drivers in fifth is Paul Sibley, who maintained his strong start to the campaign with another brace of Midget &amp; Sprite Challenge wins at Cadwell Park. These sent him climbing up from joint 11th.</p><p>However, there are a couple of drivers who added to their total but actually slipped down the leaderboard, including Connor Kay. He headed Class C in both of the Cadwell Midget &amp; Sprite bouts, but the second of these does not count towards his tally because there were not the required minimum six starters in the division. He therefore actually falls from fourth to seventh.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/connor-kay-double-win-002.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="photographer">Photo by: Gary Hawkins</p><p>Alistair Camp is also in a similar position as his sole Civic Cup success at Silverstone could not prevent him from dropping from eighth to ninth.</p><p>However, Tyler England - who enjoyed Modified Fords glory at Mallory Park in his Fiesta - does move upwards and enters the table in 10th.</p><p>Now knocking on the door of the top 10 is Scottish Legends star Ben Mason, who bagged two wins at Knockhill to rise from 33rd to 11th, while the raft of improvements continued throughout the table.</p><p>For more information about

Only classes divided by car characteristics are included, not those divided by driver characteristics such as ability, professional status, age, experience (for example rookie or Pro-Am classes).

<![CDATA[ <p>Aprilia has stood firm over <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jorge-martin/841443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Martin</a>&rsquo;s push to be released from his contract early and expects the defending MotoGP world champion to remain at the team at least until the end of 2026, it has said in a statement.</p><p>The Italian manufacturer has remained silent on the matter since <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/martin-pushing-to-exit-aprilia-contract-early-manufacturer-considering-legal-action/10722045/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autosport exclusively revealed Martin intended to invoke a clause in his contract</a> to be released from the second year of his deal for 2026, allowing him to leave at the end of the season.</p><p>The agreement signed by Aprilia and Martin last year at the Italian GP is set to hold no binding effect for the second season. Autosport understands that in the version accepted by Aprilia, Martin&rsquo;s representatives included a clause granting him full freedom to accept offers from other teams if he was not among the title contenders after last Sunday&rsquo;s French GP at Le Mans.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/why-the-conflict-between-martin-and-aprilia-is-a-bad-deal-for-both-parties/10722655/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0oOzyBx0/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Why Martin vs Aprilia conflict will have no easy resolution</a><p>But in a statement released on Thursday ahead of the British GP, Aprilia said its contract with Martin is &ldquo;valid and in effect&rdquo; for its full duration until the end of the 2026 season.</p><p>&ldquo;The contract between Aprilia Racing and Jorge Mart&iacute;n is valid and in effect, and as such, it must be respected by both parties until its expiration (end of 2026). Aprilia Racing has honoured it in full, within the agreed-upon timelines and terms, and will continue to do so in the future,&rdquo; the team statement read.</p> <img draggable="false" src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2QzVA73Y/s1000/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te.jpg" alt="Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Aprilia Racing</p><p>&ldquo;Aprilia Racing denies that any negotiations have taken place between the parties to modify the duration of the contract, which remains as originally agreed upon. The team has no comment on matters that do not directly concern it but expects other teams to refrain from making any kind of offer to riders who are under contract. Such behaviour would, in any case, not be legitimate.</p><p>&ldquo;The entire team will continue to support Jorge throughout his recovery process, as it always has, and looks forward to seeing him back on track with the RS-GP.&rdquo;</p><p>Aprilia&rsquo;s comment on it &ldquo;expect[ing] other teams to refrain from making any kind of offer to riders who are under contract&rdquo; is believed to be aimed at Honda, which could be Martin&rsquo;s destination if he is released early from his current contract.</p><p>Honda has no intention of making any move until Martin resolves his ongoing conflict with Aprilia and is officially free, while Aprilia boss Massimo Rivola held a meeting with Hikaru Tsukamoto, his Honda counterpart, at Le Mans.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/who-is-albert-valera-the-agent-at-the-centre-of-the-motogp-rider-market/10724387/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/Yv8yEW10/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-al.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Who is Albert Valera? The agent at the centre of the MotoGP rider market</a><p>The situation is remarkable following Martin&rsquo;s switch to Aprilia as reigning MotoGP world champion after winning the title last year with Pramac Ducati.</p><p>Two pre-season injuries sidelined Martin from the first three rounds in Thailand, Argentina and Austin, and he returned in Qatar, still not fully recovered, only to suffer a serious injury that resulted in nearly two weeks of hospital treatment in Doha due to a pneumothorax.</p><p>While a return to action date hasn&rsquo;t been set yet, it seems unlikely he will be fit to return before the German GP, the 11th round, scheduled for 11-13 July.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ The British racer who also benefitted from Verstappen's secret GT3 test ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Last week, someone named 'Franz Hermann' drew significant attention during a GT3 test at the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Behind this alias was none other than four-time Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen, who <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-franz-hermann-verstappen-shares-details-of-nurburgring-gt3-test/10722974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to the wheel of a Ferrari 296 GT3</a> from Swiss outfit Emil Frey Racing during an official Nurburgring Endurance Series test.</p><p>The Red Bull F1 driver collaborates with Emil Frey Racing under the Verstappen.com Racing banner and wanted to get some laps on the 'Green Hell' without attracting huge crowds of fans to the pitlane in the early morning.</p><p>He succeeded in keeping things quiet, but that also meant many quickly forgot that Verstappen wasn't the only one in the car that day. Chris Lulham, sim racer for Team Redline - Verstappen's sim racing operation - was also present.</p><p>He appeared in some photos, though remained anonymous throughout the ordeal. "We shared the car all day," Lulham told Autosport at the subsequent GT World Challenge event at Zandvoort.</p><p>"I mainly drove in the afternoon - I think I did most of the laps then. It was an incredible experience driving that track for the first time. Nothing can really prepare you for it.</p><p>"I've done thousands of laps on the simulator and even won the 24-hour sim race there several times, but nothing compares to the real thing."</p><p>Lulham has been competing with Team Redline for several years now, and not without success. The Briton has made a name for himself by winning major sim racing events, which this year earned him a seat in GT3 racing with Verstappen.com Racing.</p><p>Though he has some prior experience in karting and cars, sim racing was his path to the real racing world.</p><p>"It was a strange experience," Lulham said about his Nurburgring test. "In the afternoon, more people started showing up. I don't think many of them even realised I was in the car too..."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQRMj1Y/s1000/69-emil-frey-racing-ferrari-29.jpg" alt="#69 Emil Frey Racing, Ferrari 296 GT3: Thierry Vermeulen, Chris Lulham" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="photographer">Photo by: SRO</p><p>When it's pointed out that he was indeed visible in some of the photos, but the focus was mainly on 'Franz', Lulham laughs.</p><p>"That's a shame, isn't it?" he said. "But he was super helpful throughout the day. We had the live onboard feed in the truck, and he pointed out the little lines he had discovered.</p><p>"There are over a hundred corners on that track, so plenty of nuances to find. We helped each other with what we learned. It was a very productive day and the car was really fast."</p><p>While Verstappen's participation attracted most of the attention, the underlying purpose of the test was also a topic of discussion. According to Lulham, both drivers had a similar objective: to log miles on the Nordschleife and support the team.</p><p>"It was the first time on the Nordschleife for both of us and also about building a baseline for the team, as it was the first time the 296 had been run on that track," Lulham explained.</p><p>"We both need to get a permit if we want to race there. That's still an open question."</p><p>Lulham confirmed that he does aspire to race in the 24 Hours of the Nurburgring, but there's no guarantee he'll earn the permit this year, though.</p><p>"There are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up to make that happen," he said.</p><p>"I need to get that permit in the coming months if I want to race. For Max, it's a different story. He obviously has very limited time. Honestly, I don't know what his plans are. Hopefully, we can both race in the NLS [Nurburgring Langstrecken Serie] by the end of the year."</p><p>Lulham spent several years karting and was even runner-up in the OKJ Karting Championship in 2017. Since then, he's raced in British Formula 4 and won the SR3 class of the Radical Cup UK, but thanks to support from Verstappen.com Racing, he's now competing at the highest level of GT3 - the GT World Challenge Europe - in both sprint and endurance races.</p><p><strong>INSIGHT: <a href="https://www.autosport.com/national/news/how-verstappens-sim-team-mate-has-found-real-life-racing-success/10620207/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Verstappen's sim team-mate has found real-life racing success</a></strong></p><p>Support from Verstappen.com Racing and Verstappen himself has "been crucial" to this rise through he ranks, he said.</p><p>"We had a long winter programme that started late last year to prepare me for this season, and I think the results show that," Lulham said.</p><p>"To get into the Ferrari for the first race and immediately qualify on the front row, just two hundredths off pole... That shows what's possible with the right preparation and the right people behind you."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/33-cl-re2-6742.jpg" alt="Lulham completed plenty of mileage in the Ferrari alongside Verstappen" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Lulham completed plenty of mileage in the Ferrari alongside Verstappen</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: SRO</p><p>Lulham was surprised that he was immediately quick and able to run at the front. During the winter programme, he could already track his progress, supported by reference points from team-mate Thierry Vermeulen &ndash; son of Verstappen&rsquo;s manager Raymond &ndash; and Verstappen himself.</p><p>The adventure with Verstappen.com Racing may still be in its early stages, but Lulham is very satisfied with the support so far.</p><p>&ldquo;The Verstappen.com Racing family is a big one, with many influential people backing me and my career,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;You always feel the support, but you also feel the pressure &ndash; so it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword. But it&rsquo;s been a fantastic start.&rdquo;</p><p>Lulham is part of a growing trend of sim racers making the leap to real-life motorsport &ndash; and often, they perform well. But does real-world experience feed back into his sim racing?</p><p>&ldquo;It helps in the sense that you work with skilled engineers during real race weekends &ndash; people who&rsquo;ve been in the sport for years,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;You learn lots of small details you might miss as a sim racer, and you start thinking differently. In terms of lap time, it probably doesn&rsquo;t help, because the techniques you use in a real car differ. But I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;ll still be competitive in sim races this year.&rdquo;</p><p>Together with Vermeulen Jr, Lulham now wants to make a big impression in the Gold Cup class of the GT World Challenge. The rookie even believes a top-three finish overall is possible. The pair currently sit 10th, but at Brands Hatch &ndash; where they won the Gold Cup &ndash; an outright victory didn&rsquo;t seem far off.</p><p>&ldquo;In Sprint, I don&rsquo;t see why we couldn&rsquo;t finish in the top five, top four, or hopefully even top three,&rdquo; said Lulham. &ldquo;Every race has its own challenges, and we&rsquo;ll have highs and lows &ndash; we already have. Long-term, we&rsquo;re still early in my first season, so I don&rsquo;t know where this journey will go yet. I can&rsquo;t say anything for certain, but I&rsquo;d love to make a career out of this.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/69-0q3a1478.jpg" alt="Verstappen helped Lulham with Nordschleife advice" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Verstappen helped Lulham with Nordschleife advice</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: SRO</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Three senior figures at the Team Penske IndyCar squad have departed as the consequences from the&nbsp;Indy 500 qualifying scandal are still unfolding.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/829788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Newgarden</a> and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/will-power/829451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Will Power</a> had already <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/penske-penalized-will-power-and-josef-newgarden-to-start-last-in-indy-500/10724499/" target="_self" rel="noopener">been sent to the rear of the field,</a> the team has been fined a total of $200,000, and race strategists for each driver were suspended after illegal modifications were found on the rear attenuator of their cars.</p><p>Penske has now taken things a step further by announcing the departure of IndyCar team president Tim Cindric after 26 years with the organisation. Cindric already stepped back from his&nbsp;day-to-day leadership role in January following <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/penske-suspends-cindric-and-other-senior-staff-over-indycar-scandal/10608054/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's push-to-pass scandal</a>, while his son Austin currently competes full-time for Penske in the NASCAR Cup.</p><p>Cindric was also the chief race strategist for Newgarden, and he is not the only one being sent out of the door on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Managing director Ron Ruzewski, who was also the race strategist for Power, has been relieved of his duties after 21 years with Penske. Additionally, general manager Kyle Moyer is also departing the organisation after 11 years.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yqQoD0/s1000/tim-cindric-josef-newgarden-te.jpg" alt="Tim Cindric, Josef Newgarden, Team Penske" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Tim Cindric, Josef Newgarden, Team Penske</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>"Team Penske will have further announcements this week related to personnel and replacements for this weekend's Indianapolis 500," read a statement from the team.</p><p>Roger Penske released his first public statement since this all began on Sunday, stating: "Nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport and our race teams.</p><p>"We have had organisational failures during the last two years, and we had to make necessary changes. I apologise to our fans, our partners, and our organisation for letting them down."</p><p>Penske echoed the words of IndyCar president Doug Boles, who held a press conference on Monday where he said this scandal is "devastating" to Penske personally.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Tribal and toxic social media sour F1 fandom, but what can be done? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dozens of fans were chanting his name as their favourite Formula 1 driver climbed the pitwall after the race to greet them. But this was not a <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferrari</a> driver celebrating, let's say, a podium on home soil. Instead, it was Alpine's <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/franco-colapinto/875941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franco Colapinto</a>, who had come home in 16th place after a muted first grand prix upon his F1 return.</p><p>The attention surrounding Colapinto beggars belief. The 21-year-old appeared on the scene last year from close to nowhere, being handed Logan Sargeant's <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/williams/36474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams</a> seat in Monza after impressing team boss James Vowles through his reserve driver duties and an FP1 outing at Silverstone.</p><p>Little could have prepared Williams for the increased interest and scrutiny as Argentina yearned for its next sporting hero, 23 years after its last representative on the F1 grid. TV ratings in the region shot up, as did the masses of Argentinian fans travelling to any race they could. But, with the swell of interest, came a much more sinister undercurrent of tribalism and abuse, which has been pervading the series ever since its mainstream success through Netflix hit <em>Drive to Survive</em>, which just collected its second Sports Emmy Award.</p><h2>Football fan behaviour is about the last sport F1 fans should take clues from</h2><p>The us-versus-them attitude inextricably linked with football and select other sports has increasingly seeped into F1 as the championship attracts a much wider and less knowledgeable audience, coinciding with the advent of social media.</p><p>The bitter 2021 title fight between <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> devolved in a toxic mess online, from subsets of fans on both sides, and it triggered abuse against third parties including FIA race director Michael Masi and Williams driver <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/nicholas-latifi/841485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas Latifi</a>, whose Abu Dhabi crash was the catalyst for a dramatic turn of events that ended with Verstappen claiming a controversial title. Racing Bulls man <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/liam-lawson/841994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Lawson</a> also faced abuse after clashing with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/sergio-perez/829668/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Perez</a> at last year's Mexican Grand Prix while effectively vying for the Mexican's Red Bull seat.</p><p>As Colapinto made his return as an <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> reserve driver this year, a part of his growing fanbase took to social media to harass and pressurise <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jack-doohan/841992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a>, Colapinto's direct rival for the seat.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YXREmwN0/s1000/jack-doohan-alpine.jpg" alt="Abuse started to be directed at Doohan as soon as Colapinto entered the Alpine picture" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Abuse started to be directed at Doohan as soon as Colapinto entered the Alpine picture</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>The matter came to a head at last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix; the first in which Colapinto replaced Doohan as an Alpine race driver. A parody account fabricated an Instagram story by Doohan's father alleging to make fun of Colapinto's qualifying crash, which was reported as genuine by Argentinian media and led to a further torrent of abuse. Tsunoda also landed in the crosshairs of Argentinian accounts after he and Colapinto were involved in a common and innocuous impeding incident in Friday practice at Imola, with the Red Bull driver abused for gesticulating towards Colapinto.</p><p>It's important to stress we are talking about a vocal minority, and that numerous Argentinian fans also responded to Tsunoda's Instagram posts with messages of support for the Japanese driver, apologising for the behaviour of others. And the above mentioned examples also show it's not just an Argentinian problem, nor is it just a motorsport problem.</p><p>But, while generalising is not helpful, it would be wrong to ignore the elephant in the room. Subsets of Argentinian fans are embracing a sporting culture that has normalised vitriol and violence much more than other countries. A Copa Libertadores final - South America's equivalent to the UEFA Champions League - between the country's two football giants Boca Juniors and River Plate had to be postponed in 2018 after Boca's team bus was attacked en route to the stadium, leaving several players with injuries, the latest example of a history of violence and abuse surrounding arguably football's biggest rivalry. The second leg of the final was eventually played in Madrid for safety reasons.</p><p>It is an unfortunate by-product of a proud and patriotic fandom culture that has also been transplanted into other sports. When touring car ace Agustin Canapino headed to IndyCar in 2023 to race for the partly Argentinian-owned Juncos Hollinger Racing squad, his team-mate Callum Ilott was the target of abuse on several occasions. In 2024 McLaren's Theo Pourchaire <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/indycar-teams-condemn-pourchaire-death-threats-for-canapino-detroit-clash/10619495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also reported receiving death threats</a>&nbsp;after contact with the Argentinian at the Detroit Grand Prix.</p><p>As a result, Canapino left the series and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/arrow-mclaren-terminates-juncos-alliance-after-social-media-controversy/10620152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren called off its alliance with Juncos</a>, with the problematic part of his fans actually undermining its hero's career rather than boosting it. Those who have abused Doohan, Tsunoda and others in the name of supporting Colapinto would do well to remember that. Colapinto himself has also called on his supporters to "give respect" to his competitors.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Yv8qar70/s1000/agustin-canapino-juncos-hollin.jpg" alt="Canapino losing his IndyCar drive shows how abusive fans can hinder the drivers they idolise" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Canapino losing his IndyCar drive shows how abusive fans can hinder the drivers they idolise</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Josh Tons / Motorsport Images</p><h2>What can actually be done by the motorsport community?</h2><p>The problem F1 and other sports are facing is obviously a product of its time. Can you imagine social media existing in the days of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost?</p><p>But quite how the wider online toxicity problem can be tackled is a different matter. With good intentions, the motorsport community has already taken steps to curb abuse. In 2023 the FIA established the United Against Online Abuse (UAOA) campaign, working with sporting organisations, governments and tech companies to chart online abuse and then find solutions to tackle the issue. FOM itself and its teams have also undertaken work to stamp out abuse, with their digital teams working diligently to block inappropriate content.</p><p>As social media has become a staple of how people consume news and information, a part of the responsibility also lies with legacy news organisations. Some companies intentionally publish 'ragebait' and even organisations with the best intentions will often struggle to provide enough context and nuance on social media, where time, space and attention spans are in short supply.</p><p>The fake post attributed to Mick Doohan, which was published by an account known for parody and satire, was spread and taken at face value by Argentina's TV rightsholder on which many domestic fans are relying to understand the sport, especially newer followers who recently boarded the Colapinto hype train. The broadcaster has since apologised, but the damage was already done.</p><p>Perhaps all media companies can learn lessons from the events over the Imola weekend. But there is only so much teams, media and governing bodies can do before needing help from the social media platforms themselves. And that is appearing to be a major stumbling block.</p><p>As an FOM spokesperson said: "Formula 1 is a close community, and we all condemn these acts and will continue to work across the sport to collectively block and report abuse to social media platforms, but we need those platforms to be doing more to stop the spread of vile comments and abuse."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yqW4V0/s1000/f1-logo-lit-on-a-building-at-s.jpg" alt="F1 has waded into the debate and called on social media companies to do more" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">F1 has waded into the debate and called on social media companies to do more</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images</p><p>Meta, the parent company behind Instagram and Facebook, announced a sweeping reduction of content moderation at the start of the year, changes that were criticised by the company&rsquo;s oversight board for not doing enough to prevent the amplification of harmful content. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, the platform now branded X has also faced cuts to its global content moderation teams under the banner of free speech.</p><p>Governments have been grappling with the endemic issue of digital media's harmful influence on their population, too, with Australia recently banning children under 16 from using social media. Other administrations are closely studying Canberra's example.</p><p>Putting the social media genie back in the bottle is not an option. So, until platforms step up themselves or are being forced to, it might have to be up to all of us to educate and act responsibly, even if that means we are in for a rough ride.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ BTCC starlet Pearson taken under Huff's wing ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>British Touring Car Championship up-and-comer Ronan Pearson has been taken under the wing of his childhood hero Rob Huff under a new management deal.</p><p>The 23-year-old Scot has joined the stable of Fewkes Sport Management, where 2012 World Touring Car Championship title winner Huff is a director.</p><p>Pearson has always been open that he was obsessive about touring car racing as a child, and even has a photo of himself as a nine-year-old with Huff at the 2011 WTCC round at Donington Park.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a massive fan of Rob&rsquo;s, from the times of being up at stupid o&rsquo;clock in the morning to watch him racing around Macau,&rdquo; said Pearson.</p><p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s gone full circle. As we walked into Brands Hatch [for the most recent round of the BTCC], he was carrying my helmet into the paddock, which is a bit different!&rdquo;</p><p>Pearson raced against Huff for the first seven rounds of the 2024 BTCC season before his split with the Excelr8 Motorsport Hyundai team. Huff had returned to UK racing for his first full campaign in the series for 20 years with the Speedworks Motorsport Toyota squad, which Pearson has joined for 2025.</p><p>&ldquo;In this environment it really is important to have a support mechanism,&rdquo; Pearson added.</p><p>&ldquo;We had a day testing together at Donington with Speedworks in 2024. Rob was doing some testing for 2025 with a few developments they had in progress, and I was getting my first run-out in the car in what was its 2024 spec.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously it&rsquo;s not panned out enough for Rob to race this year, but he&rsquo;s helped me a significant amount.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/je-3670680-hires.jpg" alt="Pearson has endured a tough start to his Toyota spell but has topped his three team-mates" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Pearson has endured a tough start to his Toyota spell but has topped his three team-mates</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: JEP</p><p>Huff, who joined FSM founder Will Fewkes&rsquo;s company after the 2023 season, added: &ldquo;Having had the pleasure of racing against Ronan in the BTCC last year I know just how talented he is and the potential he possesses is huge.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a fantastic attitude and is a pleasure to work with; I&rsquo;m looking forward to what promises to be an exciting future working together.&rdquo;</p><p>Pearson has outpaced all three of his Speedworks team-mates &ndash; three-time champion Gordon Shedden, the experienced Aron Taylor-Smith and rookie James Dorlin &ndash; in the two qualifying sessions to date, making Q3 at the Donington Park opener and Q2 at Brands.</p><p>But racedays have not gone so well. A best result of 10th at Brands has left him 14th in the standings, although still the highest-placed of the Speedworks quartet.</p><p>&ldquo;The first highlight and the first goal is to beat your team-mates,&rdquo; said Pearson.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on my qualifying for the past two seasons, and I&rsquo;m chuffed that I&rsquo;ve maximised that, but we&rsquo;re not here to celebrate qualifying 10th at Brands Hatch.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of work going on between events, which can only be a good thing. The chassis is fantastic &ndash; it works very well for me, and both my engineer and I have been gelling fast.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s plain to see that the straight-line speed has not been there, and that&rsquo;s hindered us massively. It&rsquo;s been a case of playing catch-up.</p><p>&ldquo;Have we hit the ground with the car set-up? Yes. But it&rsquo;s the thing under the bonnet which makes a huge difference.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

In the unlikely event of an insulation issue, a visual and acoustic warning system immediately reports a malfunction.</p><p>In the event of a sudden deceleration (such as in a collision), a sophisticated sensor system completely shuts down the high-voltage system in a few tenths of a second.</p><p>In addition, the Mokka GSE Rally has a special extinguishing system with an electrically non-conductive extinguishing agent. Opel believes the car could be ready for competition in 2026.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Racing in the confines of a street track is always special. The wheel-to-wheel action may not always be the best, but the spectacle of top drivers flirting with the barriers make it one of the sport&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p><p>That&rsquo;s particularly true now that most conventional circuits, particularly in Formula 1, have large run-off areas. And it helps to explain why the Monaco Grand Prix, the 75th edition of which will take place this weekend, is considered by many as the jewel in F1&rsquo;s crown.</p><p>Red Bull racer Max Verstappen believes that the greater risk on street circuits means drivers approach the early part of the weekend slightly differently. Track time &ndash; and not putting it in the wall &ndash; is key.</p><p>&ldquo;On a normal track, even when you go a bit wide it's fine &ndash; you can run off if you want to,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Obviously on a street circuit it's not possible so I think you build it up a bit easier.</p><p>&ldquo;It's just about feeling the grip, because you are always sliding and there's not a lot of grip. That makes a difference between the drivers.&rdquo;</p><p>Dario Franchitti scored many of his IndyCar successes on street circuits. He has always been a fan of their demands and believes finding the limit is harder than on a conventional track.</p><p>&ldquo;I loved them all,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Even downtown Houston &ndash; it was all 90-degree corners, but it was still a hell of a challenge. Then there&rsquo;s something completely different like Surfers Paradise, which I adored.</p><p>&ldquo;I learned a lesson there. I thought I was on my limit one day and I missed the brake pedal over a bump and I managed to make the corner &ndash; I realised I could brake a lot later than I had been.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/00-13.jpg" alt="Franchitti was a huge fan of street circuits for the challenge each one posed" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Franchitti was a huge fan of street circuits for the challenge each one posed</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Eric Gilbert</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room for mistakes. If you make a slight misjudgement you generally, at best, ding a tie rod. If you clip an apex wall, it sends you into the outside wall and you&rsquo;ve done a lot of damage. It&rsquo;s the precision of it.&rdquo;</p><p>The four-time IndyCar champion also points out that commitment and confidence are big factors in finding lap time. And it&rsquo;s not just the proximity of the walls that make life difficult.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of the walls, a lot of the corners are blind, so you commit to the corner, the brakes, to getting off the brakes and running the speed without being able to see the exits,&rdquo; adds Franchitti. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really got to know what comes next, which requires a level of commitment.</p><p>&ldquo;With American and DTM street courses, the bumps and surface changes were another aspect to it &ndash; another part of the challenge. Toronto had concrete patches on the apex of every corner. You&rsquo;d come down hellishly bumpy braking zones, get off the brakes and turn in on Tarmac and then hit the concrete and have no grip, so you had to learn how to deal with that.</p><blockquote><p>"Two corners could have identical geometries but, because of the surface changes and the bumps, it completely changes how they drive" <strong>Dario Franchitti</strong></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see it now with Max Chilton [IndyCar driver and ex-F1 racer, who Franchitti helped in his role at Chip Ganassi Racing]. He&rsquo;s driven at Monaco, but he&rsquo;s never really &ndash; up until Indy Lights &ndash; driven a proper, bumpy street course. You&rsquo;ve got to read the bumps and changes in grip over the surfaces &ndash; they dictate how you drive a corner.</p><p>&ldquo;Two corners could have identical geometries but, because of the surface changes and the bumps, it completely changes how they drive. You&rsquo;re working with the car leaving the ground; I loved the challenge. It was probably my favourite discipline.&rdquo;</p><p>The different surfaces also add an extra dimension when rain arrives. Nigel Mansell blamed his 1984 Monaco GP shunt on a white line and Franchitti believes it&rsquo;s a valid point.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6xEDdJ70/s1000/nigel-mansell-lotus-95t-1.jpg" alt="Mansell's damaged Lotus after he slipped up on a normal traffic white line" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Mansell's damaged Lotus after he slipped up on a normal traffic white line</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;Wherever it is in the world the local government don&rsquo;t use FIA non-slip paint,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Zebra crossings and arrows can be in the most unfortunate places. I can see where Nigel was coming from about Monaco &ndash; he was dead on with that one!</p><p>&ldquo;Some surfaces hold the water more than others, some have got different grip levels. At Toronto, for example, the buses use the same line as you use when you&rsquo;re braking for the hairpin. So when you go down there, there are two troughs full of water.&rdquo;</p><p>Another fan of the art is Mario Andretti. The 1978 F1 world champion and four-time Indycar title winner believes street circuits require a very specific approach.</p><p>&ldquo;What I loved about them was the fact that you needed to have a very controlled aggression,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what would pay off. You had to be aggressive, but you really had to measure your slides and so forth.</p><p>&ldquo;Today, even in my two-seater [IndyCar], when I go out there&hellip; people don&rsquo;t know this but I drive the s*** out of it, and I get really close to the walls. I just love that part of it, because it paid you back.</p><p>&ldquo;The drivers that get it done always have some whitewalls on the tyres. All you have to do is leave about six inches from the wall, and you&rsquo;re not going to get your lap time. The trick is to use every inch and be bold, not be afraid of the walls. You really have to flirt with the walls and the guardrails, even on the inside. You really have to play it by the inch.&rdquo;</p><p>Street circuits thus put a premium on the things that are always important in circuit racing and highlight them. As well as precision and confidence, getting into the groove and being able to lap consistently is crucial.</p><p>Six-time Monaco winner Ayrton Senna famously talked of getting quicker and quicker during a long run, almost mesmerised between the walls. This allows some drivers to make more of a difference.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RKbZKM2/s1000/f1-monaco-gp-1990-ayrton-senna-mclaren-mp4-5b-honda.jpg" alt="Senna found he could increase his pace over a stint around Monaco even with tyre wear a detracting factor" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Senna found he could increase his pace over a stint around Monaco even with tyre wear a detracting factor</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;Rhythm is really important on a street track,&rdquo; confirms Franchitti. &ldquo;When you get in the rhythm and the car is working you can really make a gap to the opposition. The driver can make the difference, but you&rsquo;ve got to get the car working too.</p><p>&ldquo;Part of it is giving the feedback to the engineer of what you need and what you think you&rsquo;re going to need because there is a lot of track evolution. I wanted a car to work well over the bumps and be something I could be confident with.&rdquo;</p><p>From an engineering point of view, the bumps are far more of a concern than the barriers. Mark Williams, former head of vehicle engineering at McLaren, worked in Formula 3000 before reaching F1 and knows the strain street tracks put on machinery.</p><p><strong>PLUS: <a href="https://www.autosport.com/general/news/from-cart-super-touring-to-being-an-unsung-f1-hero-5110302/5110302/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From CART and Super Touring to F1 &ndash; Mark Williams</a></strong></p><p>&ldquo;When I ran cars at the Birmingham Superprix it was as bumpy as hell because the Tarmac wasn't laid for the racing line but rather as required by the Highways Agency,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So roundabouts were a nightmare and suspension components suffered.</p><blockquote><p>"I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that difficult to win Monaco &ndash; if you qualify well and you don&rsquo;t make mistakes you can win Monaco. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big a deal as some people make it" <strong>Sir Jackie Stewart</strong></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now when you walk Monaco it feels like it is laid as a race track, so the only difference to a normal circuit is the proximity of the barriers.&rdquo;</p><p>Although the Monaco GP has long been considered one of the great races, the challenge of street circuits has not always been so different to other venues. The appeal and speciality of them has grown over time as more conventional circuits have evolved.</p><p>Sir Jackie Stewart, who won three Monaco GPs, points to the lack of run-off at most tracks in the 1960s and 1970s. The approach when arriving at a street venue was therefore not dissimilar.</p><p>&ldquo;Monaco was my first street track [in F3 in 1964], which was a huge thrill because of the history of it,&rdquo; says the three-time world champion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never been to Monaco. Since 1929 it&rsquo;s been the highest level of motorsport and the big guys have won it.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0a9jXer0/s1000/jackie-stewart-tyrrell-003-for-1.jpg" alt="Stewart points out the risks of street tracks in the 1960s were not too different to purpose-built circuits" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Stewart points out the risks of street tracks in the 1960s were not too different to purpose-built circuits</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see it as anything different to a normal race track. On most circuits there were no run-off areas or kerbs. You couldn&rsquo;t make mistakes &ndash; the penalty was so big. You didn&rsquo;t have to go far to hit a wall. The discipline had to be so severe; the penalties were so severe.&rdquo;</p><p>Stewart also has an interesting take on how Monaco stacks up to other events. He places it alongside his home GP and the old Nurburgring as one of the three circuits he always wanted to win at, but doesn&rsquo;t believe it was the most challenging: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that difficult to win Monaco &ndash; if you qualify well and you don&rsquo;t make mistakes you can win Monaco. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big a deal as some people make it.</p><p>&ldquo;In 1971 I won with no rear brakes so you can&rsquo;t say I was driving on the limit to the extent you would expect. It was obviously a good win, but the fact there were no rear brakes on a place that&rsquo;s all stop and go&hellip;</p><p><strong>PLUS: <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/the-10-greatest-races-from-britains-best-f1-driver-5110180/5110180/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackie Stewart&rsquo;s greatest drives</a></strong></p><p>&ldquo;Jim Clark never won Monaco but that&rsquo;s because he drove for [Lotus boss] Colin Chapman. Monaco wasn&rsquo;t the billiard table it is today &ndash; there were kerbs and manhole covers. There was no one smoother than Jim Clark and he didn&rsquo;t run into anybody &ndash; the car didn&rsquo;t finish.&rdquo;</p><p>Monaco has certainly proved a car breaker, as well as a driving challenge, over the years. In the early days of the world championship it was not unusual for only two or three cars to cover the full 100 laps and even as late as 1996 there were only three cars running at the finish.</p><p>One thing that is beyond doubt is that street races can provide spectators with a real spectacle. They can normally get closer to the cars, and the walls help highlight the speed and sound.</p><p>At Pau, Stewart, Graham Hill and Clark used to go trackside for the support races. &ldquo;Everyone made mistakes and it was spectacular,&rdquo; says Stewart. &ldquo;Fans are closer to it [at street tracks] &ndash; Monaco and Pau are good examples.&rdquo;</p><p>Franchitti agrees with his fellow Scot: &ldquo;I always feel that street-course racing is an event. You can walk to restaurants, go for a beer &ndash; it&rsquo;s as much a party. You feel the whole city or town is getting into it.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6n9xKZlY/s1000/charles-leclerc-ferrari-sf-24.jpg" alt="Monaco remains one of the rare tracks where the action gets up close and personal to the people" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Monaco remains one of the rare tracks where the action gets up close and personal to the people</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> laid the foundation for his victory at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix with a brilliant overtake on <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a> during lap one at Imola.</p><p>The Red Bull Formula 1 driver made a sweeping move around the outside of the Tamburello chicane to take a race lead he subsequently never lost.</p><p>Verstappen has made a habit of overtaking at race starts, so here&rsquo;s a look back at five other notable opening laps from the world champion, together with Imola 2025.&nbsp;</p><h2>Imola 2021</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2y3WqQK6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, at the start" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, at the start</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images</p><p>Starting in chronological order, the first is at the location where Verstappen passed Piastri last Sunday: the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.</p><p>The Dutchman has now won four years in a row at Imola, with the first victory of the streak coming during the intense title battle with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> in 2021. The Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix was the second race that season, following the opener in Bahrain.</p><p>In the Middle East, Hamilton and Verstappen had already battled, with Verstappen initially thinking he came out on top, only for the lead to be handed back after exceeding track limits.</p><p>At Imola, it came to the first real clash between the two title rivals &ndash; one of many that year. On a wet track, Hamilton and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/sergio-perez/829668/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Perez</a> started from the front row, with Verstappen in P3. However, unlike 2025, the Dutchman made a good start and by the time they reached the first chicane he was already alongside polesitter Hamilton.&nbsp;</p><p>Verstappen claimed the inside line at Tamburello, with Hamilton trying to hold his ground on the outside &ndash; as the outside would become the inside on the second part of the chicane. However, there wasn't enough room for two cars and Hamilton ended up off the track, losing part of his front wing over the sausage kerbs.</p><p>This successful overtake gave Verstappen the lead, which he would convert into a win in a rather tumultuous race. Hamilton finished 22 seconds behind the Red Bull driver in second, but was fortunate after ending up in the gravel trap on lap 31 and having to reverse out. A red flag caused by <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/valtteri-bottas/829609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valtteri Bottas</a> and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> saved the seven-time world champion from further disaster.</p><h2>Mexico 2021</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXZlqz6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Verstappen fought back from tricky qualifying in Mexico" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Verstappen fought back from tricky qualifying in Mexico</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images</p><p>The race in Imola was a precursor to a historic F1 season. When the F1 circus arrived in Mexico later that year, the tension was already reaching boiling point.</p><p>Verstappen had just won a modern classic in Austin the week before but needed to triumph in Mexico City as well, as that track was considered favourable for Red Bull due to the high altitude. However, Verstappen&rsquo;s qualifying didn&rsquo;t go as planned, meaning he had to line up third for Sunday&rsquo;s race, giving <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> the perfect opportunity with a front-row lockout. With Bottas on pole and Hamilton alongside him, pre-race discussions mainly centred around the question: how could the Mercedes duo hold off Verstappen on the long straight leading to the first chicane?</p><p>Despite all the pre-race talk, Mercedes could not convert the front-row advantage into the desired result. The way Verstappen struck was very similar to his recent overtake at Imola.</p><p>In Mexico, Verstappen took advantage of Bottas&rsquo; slipstream, with the Finn having Hamilton on the inside. Bottas left the outside line completely open, allowing Verstappen to get alongside, with the three cars heading towards the first corner.</p><p>Just like in Imola 2025, Verstappen was on the grippier racing line, allowing him to brake significantly later than his competitors and take the lead. For Bottas, it went from bad to worse on the opening lap, as he was spun around by <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/daniel-ricciardo/829602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Ricciardo</a>. All this happened far behind Verstappen, who won by over 16s. It would be his last win before the nerve-wracking climax of the 2021 season in Abu Dhabi.</p><h2>Belgium 2022</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXrv9M6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>Half a year later, the competitive landscape in F1 looked completely different.

While Mercedes suffered from porpoising, Ferrari was the early-season pacesetter.&nbsp;</p><p>Verstappen suffered two DNFs in Bahrain and Australia and stated that it would take him 46 races to catch-up. But, by the end of August, when the field arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for the first race after the summer break, Red Bull already had the dominant package. Verstappen clocked the fastest time in qualifying, with more than half a second lead over second-placed <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/840485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>. However, due to grid penalties for changing engine components, Verstappen had to start from P14 on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/carlos-sainz/829244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Sainz</a> and Perez, starting from the front row, fancied their chances but, after the first lap, Verstappen was already in P8. With Pierre Gasly's grid slot empty, Verstappen overtook Bottas, <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/nicholas-latifi/841485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas Latifi</a>, and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/kevin-magnussen/829773/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Magnussen</a> at the start, moving up to 10th by the time he reached La Source hairpin.</p><p>From there, the championship leader played it safe, especially when <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lance-stroll/840484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Stroll</a> went off the track twice in front of him. It underlined Red Bull&rsquo;s dominance: the car was quick enough, so Verstappen didn&rsquo;t need to take any risks.&nbsp;</p><p>On lap 12, he eventually passed team-mate Perez for the lead, completing a remarkable charge through the field from P14 to victory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Japan 2022</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1P9P90/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>Strictly speaking, this wasn&rsquo;t an overtaking move. However, the way Verstappen held onto the lead in the first corner of Suzuka has to be included in the list of his best first-lap moves.</p><p>In the Land of the Rising Sun, rain was pouring down before the race, and all teams had their tents up on the grid. When the action finally started with a standing start, Leclerc had a much better getaway than Verstappen. The Ferrari driver was slightly ahead and had the inside line going into the first corner, but Verstappen took more risk on the outside and managed to retake the lead.</p><p>Once again, Verstappen found more grip on the racing line, though this was relative in the rain. He later mentioned he absolutely wanted to keep the lead, as it would give him clear visibility.</p><p>However, that clear visibility was short-lived. After chaos in the opening lap and very poor visibility for the rest of the field, the race was red-flagged after the second lap. Following the long-awaited restart, Verstappen pulled away from the competition by 27s in a shortened 28-lap race, though the early red flag caused confusion about whether full points would be awarded.</p><p>Verstappen himself was unsure as well, leading to amusing scenes behind the podium. "Should I sit there? But I&rsquo;m not champion yet? Oh, I am? No, I&rsquo;m not, right? I am? Are you sure?" When he was eventually confirmed as world champion, his manager Raymond Vermeulen smiled and told Autosport in the paddock: "It seems that things can never go normally with us."</p><h2>Brazil 2024</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXPp5g6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, overtakes Esteban Ocon, Alpine A524 " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, overtakes Esteban Ocon, Alpine A524</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lubomir Asenov / Motorsport Images</p><p>After a dominant 2023 season, Verstappen had to fight harder for the world title in 2024. Red Bull started the year strong but, from the Miami Grand Prix onward, the season took a dramatic turn as <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> became the strongest team.</p><p>But, thanks to an update in Austin, things improved slightly for Red Bull during the final third of the season, yet Verstappen still needed one more win to seal the championship. That victory came in Brazil, although it didn&rsquo;t look like it after a delayed qualifying session on Sunday morning. Verstappen got eliminated in Q2 due to a late red flag and had to start from P17 on a grid after taking an engine penalty.</p><p>&ldquo;It was an emotional rollercoaster - after qualifying, I was extremely frustrated when I got back to my room,&rdquo; Verstappen said.</p><p>But, when the lights went out, the Dutchman was determined not to let his title hopes slip away with rival <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> on pole. By the end of the first three corners, Verstappen was already in P11, having chosen the outside line at the Senna S &ndash; a move that had worked for him in 2016 as well, overtaking <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/nico-rosberg/829161/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nico Rosberg</a> around the outside.</p><p>Verstappen then overtook Hamilton along the start-finish straight at the end of the first lap, meaning he was already in the points. It turned out to be the start of perhaps the most complete race of his career: winning in the Brazilian rain and taking a big step towards the fourth title that he would eventually secure in Las Vegas.</p><h2>Imola 2025</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0mbBdNq2/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>The most recent example is, of course, Imola 2025. This time Verstappen started from the front row, next to polesitter and championship leader Piastri, but had a poor start. The Red Bull driver also saw Russell passing him, momentarily dropping Verstappen to third.</p><p>However, he positioned his RB21 well. After checking both mirrors, Verstappen ensured that Russell couldn&rsquo;t come across, preventing the Mercedes driver from taking the outside line. At the same time, he left less than a car&rsquo;s width on the right to prevent Norris from diving into that gap. The Dutch driver kept the outside line clear, which was crucial for the move that followed.</p><p>Verstappen benefitted from the extra grip on the racing line, lifting and braking about 10 metres later than Piastri. The McLaren driver admitted he was too cautious and would have approached it differently with hindsight. Verstappen entered the braking zone about 30 km/h faster than Piastri and took that momentum into the corner.</p><p><strong>PLUS: <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/go-hard-or-go-home-we-should-applaud-verstappen-seizing-the-moment/10724249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We should applaud Verstappen seizing the moment at Imola GP</a></strong></p><p>It was enough to take the lead and manage the race with a surprisingly strong pace. The situation was completely different from four years ago &ndash; the start of this list &ndash; but could it nonetheless be a sign of a title battle that lasts all the way to the final race in Abu Dhabi? Only time will tell...</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Formula 1 has urged social media platforms to take further steps to curb online abuse after <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/841444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuki Tsunoda</a> and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jack-doohan/841992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a> were on the receiving end of toxic comments.</p><p>Franco Colapinto's F1 return with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> has reignited a swell of passionate support from his Argentinian homeland, but over the past months a minority of fans have repeatedly crossed the line by harassing Doohan, who was eventually replaced by Colapinto.</p><p>The matter came to a head at last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix when a post from a parody account fabricated an Instagram story by Doohan's father alleging to make fun of Colapinto's qualifying crash, which was reported as genuine by Argentinian media and led to a further torrent of abuse.</p><p>Tsunoda also landed in the crosshairs of Argentinian accounts after he and Colapinto were involved in a common and innocuous impeding incident in Friday practice at Imola, with the Red Bull driver abused for gesticulating towards Colapinto.</p><p>It led to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alpine-fia-condemn-online-abuse-of-tsunoda-at-f1-imola-gp/10724620/" target="_self" rel="noopener">calls from Alpine and the FIA for fans to treat all competitors with respect</a>, and Colapinto also urged his supporters to calm down, saying: "They are extremely passionate, and they are always very harsh on other people. They have to give respect."</p><p>Numerous Argentinian fans also responded to Tsunoda's Instagram posts with messages of support for the Japanese driver, apologising for the behaviour of others.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQRKOGY/s1000/franco-colapinto-alpine.jpg" alt="Franco Colapinto, Alpine" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Franco Colapinto, Alpine</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>F1's governing body, the FIA, has stepped up its efforts with a recently launched campaign to tackle online abuse, while F1 and its teams have also been working to moderate comments received on their online accounts.</p><p>But, when quizzed by Autosport, F1 is now also calling on the social media platforms themselves to take decisive action.</p><p>"No one should be subject to abuse online or in any other form," F1 said in a statement provided to Autosport.</p><p>"Jack Doohan and Yuki Tsunoda are great people, very talented drivers, and ambassadors for our sport who, along with their families, should be treated with respect rather than receive abuse by people who hide behind social media.</p><p>"Formula 1 is a close community, and we all condemn these acts and will continue to work across the sport to collectively block and report abuse to social media platforms, but we need those platforms to be doing more to stop the spread of vile comments and abuse."</p><p>Some of social media's biggest platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and the Meta company behind Instagram and Facebook, have reduced their global content moderation efforts in recent months.</p><p>Speaking at Imola, <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> driver <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> said he has recently cut back from using social media.</p><p>"I enjoy not going on my phone as much as I used to," he said.

<![CDATA[ How star MotoGP rookie Aldeguer is now targeting a 2027 factory Ducati ride ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Star MotoGP rookie <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/fermin-aldeguer/945329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fermin Aldeguer</a> is targeting a factory Ducati ride for 2027 but admits to being surprised to have already scored a maiden podium.</p><p>The Spaniard celebrated his <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/motogp-french-gp-zarco-takes-dream-home-victory-in-frantic-race/10721848/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first podium in the premier class two weeks ago at Le Mans</a>, in just his sixth MotoGP Grand Prix.</p><p>However, it was a result that had been building for some time, as the Gresini rider had already impressed with a fifth place two rounds beforehand in Qatar.</p><p>"If someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I&rsquo;d be on the podium in my sixth MotoGP race, I would&rsquo;ve told them to go lie down," Aldeguer joked on Motorsport.com's Spanish language MotoGP podcast.</p><p>Aldeguer&rsquo;s season has steadily improved as he&rsquo;s become more comfortable with the Ducati. In Austin, the third stop on the calendar, he crashed out while chasing fourth after an incredible comeback; in Qatar, he was just seven seconds behind race winner <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/marc-marquez/829758/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Marquez</a>; and at Le Mans, he stunned with back-to-back podiums &mdash; both in the sprint and the main race.</p><p>These results place him eighth in the overall standings, ahead of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/ai-ogura/864914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ai Ogura</a> (10th) and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/somkiat-chantra/864049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somkiat Chantra</a> (last), making him the best rookie so far.</p><p>Aldeguer's move to MotoGP was long-planned, having <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/ducati-announces-aldeguer-signing-for-2025-but-not-where-he-will-race/10588685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been finalised at the end of 2023</a>. His deal, signed directly with Ducati, spans four years in two separate two-year phases. This structure not only gives him peace of mind to develop, but also a clear goal to aim for.</p> <img draggable="false" src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQR97wY/s1000/fermin-aldeguer-gresini-racing.jpg" alt="Aldeguer has been riding high in MotoGP" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Aldeguer has been riding high in MotoGP</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Dorna</p><p>At just 20 years old, Aldeguer believes that, if he continues progressing as expected, he could land a seat in Ducati&rsquo;s factory team in 2027 &mdash; the year both Marquez's and Francesco Bagnaia's contracts expire.</p><p>"The goal of every rookie riding for a satellite team is to end up in the factory team - I&rsquo;m lucky that my contract is directly with Ducati," he said.</p><p>"This year we pretty much have the same bike as the factory riders. Given my age and this contract, I&rsquo;ve got a bit of an advantage over the others.</p><p>"I have a four-year contract, two plus two. If my results are good, the jump to the factory team should happen in 2027. We&rsquo;ll see what happens, but that&rsquo;s the plan."</p><p>Aldeguer has also credited team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-marquez/829673/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Marquez</a> for helping him to adapt to MotoGP so quickly with the pair working well together.</p><p>"Alex has opened the door for me in an incredible way - I expected that, given the kind of person he is, but he&rsquo;s gone above and beyond," said Aldeguer.</p><p>"One time, at the last minute, he changed his mind about the tyre he was going to use, and he came to my office &mdash; half-dressed in his undersuit &mdash; to tell me he'd changed his mind, just so I wouldn&rsquo;t think he was trying to trick me."</p><p>Now that he&rsquo;s secured his first MotoGP podium, the next goal is, naturally, to take the top step. It&rsquo;s a challenge that motivates him and one he sees as possible, though he&rsquo;s not letting it become an obsession.</p><p>"Now I do believe it&rsquo;s possible to win a race in my first year, because I&rsquo;m feeling really good," Aldeguer said. "When it happens, it happens. Some tracks will suit me better, others worse.</p><p>"Of course, I&rsquo;d love for it to happen at Silverstone, where I got my first win in Moto2. But I&rsquo;m not going to lose my mind over it."</p><p>However, should he achieve that remarkable feat, it would make him the youngest winner in MotoGP history (20 years and 50 days), beating Marc Marquez&rsquo;s record by 13 days.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Why F1 Imola GP was still positive for Aston Martin despite no points ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Aston Martin&rsquo;s history with upgrades is rocky to say the least, with the British team often struggling to find form once it starts strapping new parts to its Formula 1 car.</p><p>At Imola last weekend, for example, the British side brought a raft of updates to the AMR25 and still left the Italian track without a point leaving it seventh in the championship.</p><p>But Aston Martin is a side undergoing regeneration, having recently moved into an impressive new campus and added star hirings like Adrian Newey. It also has one of the newest wind tunnels on the current grid, which finally burst into life just as the 2025 season started.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is why Aston Martin&rsquo;s start to 2025, including it finishing 11th (<a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/829156/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Alonso</a>) and 15th (<a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lance-stroll/840484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Stroll</a>) at Imola, adds to the frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It's one of those where you can certainly be disappointed about missing out on a point by less than a second,&rdquo; said Andy Cowell, Aston Martin team principal.</p><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t quite tell the whole story of the squad&rsquo;s weekend, as it showed real promise until the grand prix. Stroll qualified eighth, his highest of the season so far, while Alonso placed his AMR25 in fifth &ndash; his best performance since the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKE71Bk0/s1000/andy-cowell-aston-martin-racin.jpg" alt="Andy Cowell, Aston Martin Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Andy Cowell, Aston Martin Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>As a result, the pair seemed nailed on for a points-paying finish, yet a combination of a full safety car plus virtual safety cars scuppered Aston Martin's chances as others received a free stop.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Cowell still said there are positives the team can take from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.</p><p>&ldquo;The positive is we've brought an update that's made the car quicker and, up to the point that a random VSC [virtual safety car] comes out, everything was going okay,&rdquo; Cowell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, I think in the moment everybody's despondent, but I think by tomorrow everybody will be like &lsquo;right come on let's do more of that, let's look at all the areas of the car and how do we push more&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The feeling was echoed by Alonso after the race, as he said the team &ldquo;finally&rdquo; had a &ldquo;strong car that can score points on merit&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This marks a stark contrast to this time last year, when Aston Martin started upgrading its AMR24 and performance appeared to go backwards. Now, the team has finally managed to bring new parts that make a real difference on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/27vdqlm0/s1000/safety-car.jpg" alt="Safety car" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Safety car</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Luca Bruno / Pool / AFP via Getty Images</p><p>&ldquo;The thing we were struggling with last year was that we were creating updates that might be good at a high-speed circuit but worse at a low speed,&rdquo; Cowell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What we've done is bring an update that is good at low-, medium- and high-speed and so that is a positive step forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly how much quicker is it? I'm not going to declare. I'll tell you in Abu Dhabi [the season finale].&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And the team clearly has faith in the new parts. It elected to run Friday&rsquo;s practice session in Imola with one driver using the old spec AMR25 and the other using the upgraded model. This gave Aston data to directly compare the two on the same track and in the same conditions, which Cowell says shows that on &ldquo;every single corner the package was better&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, the launch spec of the AMR25 was signed off in January, while the upgrades left the wind tunnel once the 2025 season got underway in March. This means that these upgrades are the first parts to be developed with the team's new wind tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the data Aston collected at Imola will enable the team to better calibrate its new tunnel, which will help set it on the right path for its next phase of upgrades. This, Cowell says, means that Aston is finally moving in the &ldquo;right direction&rdquo; as it works to transform its season and prepare for F1&rsquo;s new ruleset in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>So, while Aston Martin may be disappointed to not add any extra points to its haul in Imola, the data and learnings it takes away from the race could prove to be even more pivotal to the side&rsquo;s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren and Ben Hunt</em></p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/how-antonelli-struggled-to-cope-with-pressures-of-home-f1-race-at-imola/10724714/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YW78jgDY/s2/andrea-kimi-antonelli-mercedes-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">How Antonelli struggled to cope with pressures of home F1 race at Imola</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/fia-issued-technical-directives-before-imola-gp-but-did-they-have-an-effect/10724626/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6gpl1pl0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">FIA issued technical directives before Imola GP, but did they have an effect?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> Formula 1 rookie <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/andrea-kimi-antonelli/953410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrea Kimi Antonelli</a> admitted the buzz around his Imola homecoming weekend left him short on energy as he suffered a tricky event.</p><p>Antonelli's first grand prix start on Italian soil - just down the road from his native city of Bologna - did not turn out the way he or Mercedes had in mind, with the 18-year-old struggling for confidence in the car on Saturday before he and team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> battled with excessive tyre overheating in the race.</p><p>Russell salvaged seventh, while Antonelli was initially able to keep <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> at bay during the first stint but ended up retiring with a throttle issue.</p><p>It was an anticlimax for Antonelli after a huge build-up to the race, which started by celebrating Bologna FC's domestic cup success and involved Antonelli inviting all of his classmates to the paddock. Antonelli was also seen going out of his way to make time for fans in the paddock, handing out photographs and taking selfies.</p><p>It was a memorable weekend for Antonelli, which he understandably tried to savour. But, coming just seven races into his fledgling F1 career, he also felt that he is yet to master how to manage all the attention, admitting the whole experience left him lacking energy inside the cockpit.</p><p>"Overall, I think the weekend was probably the worst in terms of performance, so that's why I'll try to recover well and be back stronger in Monaco," Antonelli said.</p><p>"I absolutely love the support of the fans. I just think on my side I didn't manage the energy that well, and that compromised definitely the performance on track. I could feel it. I was not as relaxed, I was a bit more tense while driving.</p><p>"So, ahead of the next home race, it was a really good lesson. But now we focus on Monaco, because it's going to be important to be on top of the game."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99kqlqY/s1000/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-andrea-.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>Antonelli also acknowledged that perhaps he needs to be a bit more selective in a race weekend with how he invests his time and energy. "I need to learn as well sometimes to say 'no' and take a bit more time for myself," he added.</p><p>Team representative Bradley Lord acknowledged that both Mercedes and Antonelli will be taking on board lessons from the Imola weekend as the squad balances out Antonelli's schedule during his rookie campaign.</p><p>"For all of us, and for Kimi, the highest priority first and foremost is performance," Lord said when asked by Autosport how challenging it was to manage the hype around its latest star.</p><p>"We knew this would be a big weekend and there's been a lot of attention. I think within the team we've seen him as focused as ever and concentrated. But, obviously, experiencing all of this for the first time, all the things you can control but also all the things you can't control, is a new phenomenon.</p><p>"We've got to view it as a learning experience, understand what were the moments that lifted him and gave him energy, and which bits potentially felt like overload. And then we'll adapt for both busy race weekends and particularly for the next home race in Italy in September as we go forward."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/six-appeal-how-pirellis-controversial-new-tyre-will-shape-the-monaco-gp-and-beyond/10724521/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0k7OdEj0/s2/the-pirelli-motorhome.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Six appeal: how Pirelli&rsquo;s controversial new tyre will shape the Monaco GP and beyond</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Hyundai returned to form in Portugal but it will postpone any decision to run a fourth car until it is happy with its upgraded World Rally Championship challenger&rsquo;s performance.</p><p>The Korean marque bounced back from its crushing Canary Islands defeat last month by taking the fight to Toyota in Portugal last weekend.</p><p>Hyundai appeared to have the edge on Toyota on gravel in what was the upgraded i20 N&rsquo;s first event on the loose surface this year. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/ott-tanak/829695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ott Tanak</a> and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/adrien-fourmaux/869791/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adrien Fourmaux</a> topped the standings on Friday before the latter suffered a suspension failure. Tanak won 12 of the 24 stages to finish second but would have most likely won the rally had he avoided a power steering failure on Saturday.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/how-ogier-pounced-on-rally-portugal-win-that-got-away-from-tanak/10724414/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/68yqoo90/s2/sebastien-ogier-vincent-landai.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">How Ogier pounced on Rally Portugal win that got away from Tanak</a><p>&ldquo;This weekend has been a return to the form we expect of ourselves. We have been incredibly competitive throughout the event, with Ott expertly spearheading the charge.

Sordo was present at last weekend&rsquo;s Rally Portugal which also acted as a round for the national series.</p><p>Sordo&rsquo;s most recent WRC Rally1 return was last year&rsquo;s Acropolis Rally, where the 42-year-old finished second behind Neuville. There had been suggestions Sordo could have made a return in Sardinia next month although his name was absent from the entry list.</p><p>&ldquo;There is still a chance for a fourth car,&rdquo; said Abiteboul during Rally Portugal.</p><p>&ldquo;The Canary Islands has been a shock to the system and when there is a shock to the system what you need to do is regroup and think and put on standby some of the action we had planned, and in particular think about the best way to use the financial resources you have available.</p><p>&ldquo;Running a fourth car needs more resources in terms of staff, financial resources and logistics.

Then if you have the confidence, you can play tactics with a fourth car.</p><p>&ldquo;There is also the case that obviously with more cars you have more test days coming and therefore learn more about the Hankook tyres.</p><p>"We thought about that, but it is an expensive way to get access to more information about the tyres. We like to think we can get to the same result in a different way.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ FIA issued technical directives before Imola GP, but did they have an effect? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>In the week leading up to the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the FIA clarified some aspects of the technical regulations through technical directives (TD) - which is a common procedure in itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Autosport has learned that these were not actual changes to the regulations, but clarifications of what the rules specified and their intended purposes.</p><p>The first clarification involves materials used around the skid blocks and their mounting. This is an important aspect with the current ground-effect cars, as teams want to lower the ride height as much as possible, but the floor cannot be excessively worn, as teams still need to pass the FIA's technical inspection, which is measured at the skid blocks areas.</p><p>The second clarification is related to devices and ways for keeping the tyres as cool as possible, where the FIA in response to questions from another team has clarified which methods are not allowed.</p><h2>Did it have an effect?</h2><p>Regarding the latter, Red Bull has drawn attention to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> in recent weeks. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> told Dutch media during the Miami Grand Prix: "If you look at what McLaren is doing with the rear tyres, then we&rsquo;re all doing something wrong."</p><p>When McLaren missed out on victory at Imola, Christian Horner commented during his post-race media session: "We were sort of more surprised about McLaren's lack of performance."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQRKZ1Y/s1000/lando-norris-mclaren-oscar-pia.jpg" alt="Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>Technical director Pierre Wache told media including Autosport that Red Bull's upgrade step wasn't as significant as it seemed, and that McLaren wasn't as strong as he anticipated.</p><p>That said, McLaren immediately made clear that nothing had changed for them. Team principal Andrea Stella already said during Friday's press conference that rivals are focussing on the wrong things: "I hope that in the future there will be more of these kinds of sagas because it means that our rivals keep focussing on the wrong things, and this is just good news for us. It&rsquo;s helping our quest."</p><p>The team claims that nothing has changed around the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, and other voices in the paddock share this view. Oscar Piastri's MCL39 was checked by the FIA after the Miami Grand Prix and found to be in order, which was confirmed with an FIA document on Thursday in Imola.</p><h2>Is Red Bull's progress track-specific? Barcelona an interesting test</h2><p>Verstappen was just as cautious about drawing far-reaching conclusions after the race that he won. The Dutchman believes that Red Bull's strength in Imola was to a large extent related to the track layout.</p><p>"I think it's very track specific," the world champion said. "I mean, every time that we have been really competitive, it&rsquo;s been high-speed tracks, high-speed corners.</p><p>"Of course, we brought upgrades. I think they worked, but Monaco is very different. It&rsquo;s not been our strongest track with the car that we have, so let's see how we are going to perform there."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YMdwgB32/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>It fits the pattern of the season so far, as Verstappen has also been competitive at Suzuka and Jeddah - two track with many high-speed corners.</p><p>Red Bull faced more problems on tracks with slow-speed corners, as seen clearly in Bahrain and Miami.</p><p>Monaco is atypical and not representative of what&rsquo;s to come, but the Spanish Grand Prix will be an interesting test - especially as the FIA will clamp down on flexi wings even further, the front wings in particular.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/six-appeal-how-pirellis-controversial-new-tyre-will-shape-the-monaco-gp-and-beyond/10724521/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0k7OdEj0/s2/the-pirelli-motorhome.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Six appeal: how Pirelli&rsquo;s controversial new tyre will shape the Monaco GP and beyond</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> Formula 1 team and the FIA have condemned online abuse towards <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/841444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuki Tsunoda</a> after a practice clash with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/franco-colapinto/875941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franco Colapinto</a> at F1's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.</p><p>Colapinto impeded several drivers in FP1 as he got back up to speed on his F1 return with Alpine, with Red Bull's Tsunoda gesticulating angrily at being blocked.</p><p>The clash was a typical Friday practice incident without any significance, but a subset of Argentinian fans still hurled abuse - some racially tinged - at Tsunoda on the Japanese driver's Instagram account.</p><p>Both before the weekend and after qualifying Colapinto urged his fans to treat other drivers with respect, and he added Tsunoda was "right" to be upset. His Alpine team and governing body the FIA have now also spoken out against the online abuse Tsunoda has received over the weekend from a small minority of fans.</p><p>"As an F1 team, we believe we are fortunate to be part of a global sport that evokes great passion and emotions, with an ever-growing community of fans who enthusiastically follow their favourite drivers' every move, whether it be a brave overtake on track or what style they are sporting when they arrive in the paddock," Alpine's statement read.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jX4Vmz6/s1000/franco-colapinto-alpine-f1.jpg" alt="Franco Colapinto, Alpine F1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Franco Colapinto, Alpine F1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images</p><p>"We encourage everyone to remember that behind the visor of these superhuman athletes there is a person, an individual with feelings, family, friends and loved ones.</p><p>"As a team, we cannot condone online abuse and urge all fans of this sport we love, to be kind and respectful."</p><p>FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who has commissioned a campaign to tackle online abuse, said: "Motorsport is built on competition, passion, and commitment, and every race drivers take to the track representing these values.</p><p>"That passion and excitement that we feel for our sport should unite us and never be twisted into abuse or hate.</p><p>"I stand in full support of Yuki Tsunoda and Franco Colapinto, and I thank them for speaking out against the growing issue of online abuse in motorsport."</p><p>Over the weekend, Alpine reserve driver Jack Doohan - who made way for Colapinto in Imola - also had to urge fans to stop harassing him and his family.</p><p>A social media&nbsp;parody account falsely portrayed his father Mick appearing to mock Colapinto's qualifying crash, which was spread by various news outlets and triggered the latest wave of abuse Doohan has received over the past five months.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/fia-issued-technical-directives-before-imola-gp-but-did-they-have-an-effect/10724626/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6gpl1pl0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">FIA issued technical directives before Imola GP, but did they have an effect?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Six appeal: how Pirelli’s controversial new tyre will shape the Monaco GP and beyond ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>On-track overtaking in Monaco is a rare commodity &ndash; drivers were complaining about the narrowness of the streets when Tazio Nuvolari was in his pomp.</p><p>Indeed, we reckon the last time the world&rsquo;s greatest drivers graced the principality with a genuine pass for the lead on anything other than the first lap was in 1985, when Michele Alboreto elbowed his way past Alain Prost at Sainte Devote at the beginning of lap 24. Pit strategy and incidents account for most changes of position here.</p><p>Last year, a red flag after a three-car shunt on the opening tour enabled the entire field to perform the required change from one tyre compound to another during the hiatus. The result was a processional tyre-management plod in which the points-paying positions worked out in grid order.</p><p>&ldquo;I think at one point we were going slower than Formula 2,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>, who finished second to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/840485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>.</p><p>Nobody wanted to pit again and lose track position so, even though the field was circulating at a reduced pace, there was very little overtaking attempted because tyre management took priority. In February, the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/fia-confirms-mandatory-two-stop-strategy-for-f1-monaco-gp/10698679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIA&rsquo;s World Motorsport Council rubber-stamped a proposal from F1&rsquo;s stakeholders to require all drivers to use at least three sets of tyres in the Monaco race</a>, effectively making it a two-stopper at minimum.</p><p>This is a sticking-plaster solution at best, and not one which will be applied to other races since the likelihood is that teams would simply converge around the same pitstop timing. For there to be strategic variety, a number of different options with potential upsides have to be on the table &ndash; and that is why Pirelli has such high hopes for the new C6 tyre, created with street circuits like Monaco in mind but deployed for the first time at Imola last weekend.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/254MEXx0/s1000/oscar-piastri-mclaren.jpg" alt="Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>At the moment, the selection of three different dry-weather compounds Pirelli brings to each weekend is drawn from adjacent members of what was, until last weekend, a five-compound family. If the C6 can be rolled out at more grand prix weekends than originally intended, it opens the possibility of &lsquo;skipping&rsquo; compounds so there is a bigger performance differential between them.</p><p>&ldquo;Teams always find a way to apply a strategy on one stop,&rdquo; said Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola last weekend. &ldquo;We are trying to push them to have a two-stop strategy because it's better, it's more action, more unpredictability, and better races.</p><p>&ldquo;But with the three compounds that are so close, they always try to use the hard and the medium to move to a one-stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Compounds being too similar is an issue which has cropped up before, but has become more of a factor this year after Pirelli adjusted them to make them more resilient &ndash; because drivers demanded to have tyres they could push on for longer. This has led to fewer contests with offset strategies, where drivers on fresher tyres at the end of a race chase down those who have opted to stick it out on older ones.</p><p>Since the compounds are homologated and cannot be changed in-season, the only option is to find other ways to use the ones that already exist. Pirelli plans to run fresh simulations for the coming races based on data gathered on the latest rubber during the opening rounds.</p><p>This, reckons Isola, will enable Pirelli to &ldquo;see if there is any solution, like, to skip one level, to have a hard that is harder &ndash; so if you want to use the hard you are penalised by the lap time. You can push but it's slower.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2eADGKl2/s1000/mario-isola-racing-manager-pir.jpg" alt="Mario Isola, Racing Manager, Pirelli Motorsport, on the grid" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Mario Isola, Racing Manager, Pirelli Motorsport, on the grid</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;And we need to understand if with this system we encourage some of them to move to a soft-medium choice for the race &ndash; that is a two-stop race in this case, and if you want to stay on one-stop, medium-hard, your pace is lower than the other.&rdquo;</p><p>Where the C6 comes in, and why Pirelli wanted to try it at Imola as well, is to facilitate that spread of performance. When the new compound was first mooted as an even softer option than the existing C6, it was expected to be used only in Monaco and perhaps Las Vegas &ndash; a faster street circuit but one with lower ambient temperatures since the race takes place at night. Now, Pirelli is bringing it to Canada and talking about Baku, Singapore and even Mexico.</p><p>But first it needed to be tested in race conditions at a venue other than Monaco, for reasons Pirelli chief engineer Simone Berra explained last weekend.</p><p>&ldquo;Collecting the information for the C6 in Monaco was not really significant,&rdquo; he explained last weekend. &ldquo;Monaco is a particular circuit, you can have graining just because of the smooth tarmac and low-speed corners and all these kinds of situations.</p><p>&ldquo;For us it's really important to collect data here [Imola] for the C6, also for the selection for the second part of the season.&rdquo;</p><p>Imola was a proof of concept to see if the C6 could handle corners which put more energy through the tyre. The key lesson so far seems to be that it has a sharp performance peak so, at a circuit like Imola with fast, flowing corners, thermal stresses build up quickly and it can slip out of its optimal performance &lsquo;window&rsquo;, even over the course of one lap.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2548wNQ0/s1000/sergio-perez-red-bull-racing-r.jpg" alt="Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB20, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, in the queue to leave the pits" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB20, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, in the queue to leave the pits</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images</p><p>The medium-compound tyre then became theoretically the better qualifying choice, but using it required earmarking sets for the race. While this is a strategic element which potentially adds interest, it's understood that the stakeholders&rsquo; preferred route is to have differentiation between compounds and potential race pace rather than this kind of &lsquo;jeopardy&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Looking at the result here [Imola],&rdquo; said Berra, &ldquo;we can, let's say, evaluate better if it's too risky or not really. For example, for Singapore we are thinking about bringing the C6, and also starting to jump compounds.</p><p>&ldquo;So for example, bringing C2, C4, C6 at some circuits to try something different, or C3, C4 and C6, to try to differentiate strategic approaches.&rdquo;</p><p>For this, the C6 will have to be at the very least a good qualifying tyre. But at least it&rsquo;s been more successful already than a previous attempt to add a softer step to the tyre portfolio.</p><p>Back in 2018, under a different naming regime, Pirelli introduced a &lsquo;hypersoft&rsquo; tyre in Monaco and the unintended consequence was a largely processional race in which drivers tiptoed round during their stint on the new compound. Having a minimum of two stops will at least mean this year&rsquo;s race won&rsquo;t pan out in exactly the same way.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/what-happened-to-mclarens-pace-advantage-on-red-bull-at-f1-imola-gp/10724505/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6VRzVy46/s2/oscar-piastri-mclaren-max-vers-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">What happened to McLaren's pace advantage on Red Bull at F1 Imola GP?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Carey breaks Bishopscourt lap record en route to glory ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Like Christmas, it only comes once a year. However, unlike Christmas, the British Automobile Racing Club-bannered Bishopscourt event lasts only two days, and presents a unique opportunity for car racers to sample the Northern Irish track that is otherwise exclusively a motorcycle venue.</p><p>For many it&rsquo;s a chance to really extend their machinery &ndash; and themselves &ndash; on a circuit that probably has more in common with Thruxton or some versions of Silverstone, than any other venue on the island of Ireland.</p><p>Once part of the Cold War early warning system, Bishopscourt first hosted motor racing in the early 1960s on a very fast three-mile lap that presented many slipstreaming opportunities. At this point the venue was still an active RAF base but, when that closed, so too did the circuit, which shut in the mid-1970s.</p><p>Jump forward 20 years and it opened again, but privately-owned by then and firmly in the hands of the bikers, who have been running it successfully ever since, despite occasional difficulties with local residents and the authorities. Then, 11 years ago, cars returned for an annual two-day outing at a venue that was now about half the original acreage. The circuit&rsquo;s present length is 1.8 miles and includes the original uber-fast downhill Turns 1 &amp; 2.</p><p>BOSS Ireland was the headline act and produced a grid of 12 cars &ndash; to begin with &ndash; but this was soon whittled down by &lsquo;circumstance&rsquo; and a smattering of red flags. There were four of them in race one, caused by mechanical problems. However, despite the stop-start nature of the race, the Formula 3 Dallaras of Cian Carey and Tony Greenan romped away from the rest. Michael Connolly&rsquo;s Dallara World Series placed third but, in the second act later, was involved in a startline adventure along with fellow World Series pilot Martin Daly and the Dallara Cosworth of Paul O&rsquo;Connell.</p><p>Carey and Greenan charged away once more upon the restart, Carey&rsquo;s younger car (320) leaving a new outright circuit record with a 107.55mph average speed as he stroked away from Greenan&rsquo;s slightly older machine (F317). Daniel Faherty, also Dallara mounted, took the third podium position.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/colm-blackburn-1239-1.jpg" alt="There were two very narrow Irish Formula Vee victories for Blackburn" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">There were two very narrow Irish Formula Vee victories for Blackburn</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Michael Chester</p><p>Irish Formula Vee never lacks entertainment, and featured more red flags, but it was Colm Blackburn who crossed the line first in both races by less than a second from Conor Melia. Kieran Hannan and Gavin Buckley were also close to the leaders, taking a third place apiece.</p><p>Among the SEAT Supercopas, Max Turley twice did the business, although was aided by a track-limits penalty for Dave Maguire in race two, while Keith Hogg also did the double in Formula Sheane. Jackie Cochrane did likewise with his &lsquo;NASCAR&rsquo; Sunbeam Tiger among the historics, son-in-law Gareth Thompson flying wingman in both races with the unique Ginetta G10.</p><p>Irish Touring Cars proved to be a Honda benefit, Cian Walsh taking both victories from Robert Savage, although Paul Twomey managed to get a Nissan into third spot in the opener.</p><p>Mondello-based Strykers fielded a pair of strong grids with Kevin McGrath heading Niall McFadden and Nicole Drought over the line in race one, while Drought turned the tables to prevail in the second encounter. Mark Francis, brother Richard and Paul Thompson topped the lists in NI Sevens the first time around, with the brothers swapping places in the sequel.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/mark-francis-1055.jpg" alt="The Francis brothers took a NI Sevens win apiece, with Mark topping the opener " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">The Francis brothers took a NI Sevens win apiece, with Mark topping the opener</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Michael Chester</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>At the Miami Grand Prix <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> denied <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> pole but only crossed the finish line in fourth in the race, nearly 40 seconds adrift of winner <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a> in the second <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>.</p><p>Fast-forward two weeks and Verstappen not only defeated both papaya drivers, but did so comfortably. If his Japanese Grand Prix win was largely down to retaining track position in a strategy-starved race, then the four-time world champion was good value for his win in Emilia-Romagna, being pretty closely matched throughout the contest with much better tyre wear than anticipated.</p><p>So, what happened? And was Imola's turnaround the result of Red Bull overperforming or McLaren missing the mark?</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/analysis-the-data-behind-verstappens-impressive-overtake-on-piastri-at-imola/10724392/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0L1N41a2/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Analysis: The data behind Verstappen's impressive overtake on Piastri at Imola</a><p>Both McLaren and Red Bull headed to the first race of the European season armed with modest upgrades, with McLaren adding downforce to the rear corner of the car and bringing a circuit-specific rear wing. Red Bull, too, optimised its rear corner aero as well as its sidepods, changes which compound the effect of a redesigned floor which Verstappen already ran in Miami.</p><p>As well as adding outright aerodynamic load, Imola's improvements appeared to have helped Red Bull keep its tyre temperatures under control, which was a limiting factor in races like Miami and Bahrain, where the team was also well beaten by McLaren. Ordinarily you would have expected Verstappen to start out strong but then start sliding and fading. Yet in Imola Piastri was the first to blink, pitting after just 14 laps.</p><p>"We've definitely managed to put some performance on the car and get it into a better window," Horner said. "And as soon as you take away the sliding, you're able to manage the temperature a lot better.</p><p>"The McLarens on Friday looked very, very fast on the long runs. But that's the first time I can remember in a long time we've had the pace to really pull away and out-deg the McLaren. So, that's very encouraging and a great result for the effort that's gone in behind the scenes."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YW78mKeY/s1000/lando-norris-mclaren-oscar-pia.jpg" alt="Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>Horner also pointed out that Red Bull was "more surprised about McLaren's lack of performance", with his McLaren counterpart Andrea Stella mirroring those thoughts.</p><p>"I have to say we were a little surprised by the pace of Red Bull, which was very competitive," Stella acknowledged. "Well done to Max and Red Bull for being able to pull off this kind of performance, which meant that the race was very much decided by the swap of position between Oscar and Max in corner one. After that we tried to chase him, but effectively we didn't have enough race pace to be able to beat Max."</p><p>Stella pointed out that one major factor was Imola's traditional track layout, which featured more high-speed corners through which McLaren's MCL39 has met its match in the Red Bull RB21.</p><p>Qualifying GPS data showed Verstappen slightly ahead of Piastri down the fast left-handers of Rivazza and on the second half of most straights, with McLaren generally enjoying better traction and acceleration out of corners. The end result was a pole for Piastri by a mere 0.034s, with Mercedes' <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> just a tenth behind as well.</p><p>"If we look at the speed of the corners compared to Miami, it's a completely different regime," the Italian explained. "The car operates in a completely different part of the aerodynamic maps. We know that our car is strong on track layouts like Miami, Bahrain or China, but when it comes to high-speed corners like we have here in Imola, I don't think we enjoy any particular advantage. So the track layout, the progress of Red Bull, I think they are the two factors that meant that we didn't have much advantage."</p><p>One emerging trend has been McLaren's prowess in hot conditions, which helped it stand out with its superior rear tyre management on the aforementioned circuits. Quite why that advantage was absent in a warm Imola race - on Pirelli's softest tyre compounds too - is yet to be fully explained. "It's a good question. We will have to look at the data, we will have to look at the behaviour of the tyres and their thermal regime," Stella said.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qX5NX46/s1000/oscar-piastri-mclaren.jpg" alt="Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>Is it possible that Red Bull may have finally unlocked something with its upgrades and set-up work to keep its rear tyres under control?</p><p>"I'll tell you in a week," said Horner. "Generally, we're getting a better understanding, and the technical team have been working very hard on it. We genuinely thought it was going to be very tough to beat McLaren, so it was very reassuring that actually our degradation was better than theirs.</p><p>"I think we're starting to understand. The upgrades were mainly focused on characteristics rather than ultimate downforce. We've managed to address, hopefully subtly, some of the characteristics, which is encouraging for the upcoming races."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/norris-max-was-too-quick-for-us/10724162/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6VRzVmL6/s2/lando-norris-mclaren-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Norris on F1 Imola GP: "Max was too quick for us"</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/analysis-the-data-behind-verstappens-impressive-overtake-on-piastri-at-imola/10724392/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/2wBNoQ30/s2/oscar-piastri-mclaren-max-vers-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Analysis: The data behind Verstappen's impressive overtake on Piastri at Imola</a><p>If those findings are confirmed in Monaco - where Red Bull struggled last year - and the high-downforce layout of Barcelona, perhaps the 2025 championship really won't be a McLaren walkover after all.</p><p>But just like it would have been unproductive for Red Bull to panic after Bahrain or Miami, it also can't wheel away in jubilation either. Both teams will bring more upgrades to Barcelona in two weeks' time, when a stricter FIA directive on front wing flexing forces the grid to tweak its designs.</p><p>"No, I'm not confident anywhere," said Red Bull's tech chief Pierre Wache. "We were [competitive] in Japan and we were destroyed in Bahrain and Miami. Clearly, it's not [taken for] granted in this business. They develop and they have a very good car. Then we still have to push hard.</p><p>"I'm not sure it was a big improvement, but it was an improvement in the right direction."</p> ]]>

The same issue existed on Power's car and Penske attempted to fix it in the pitlane.</p><p>However, these modifications were not allowed and<a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/rookie-robert-shwartzman-earns-shock-indy-500-pole-with-prema-racing/10724407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> they were denied a shot at the Indy 500 pole</a>&nbsp;that was taken by rookie <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/robert-shwartzman/841976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Shwartzman</a>.</p><p>Newgarden was set to start next weekend&rsquo;s Indy 500 in 11th and Power 12th, but some competitors believed this was unfair, and on Monday, IndyCar officials relegated Newgarden to 32nd and Power 33rd on the grid - the very rear of the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The integrity of the Indianapolis 500 is paramount, and this violation of the IndyCar rule against modification to this part and using it &lsquo;as supplied&rsquo; is clear,&rdquo; IndyCar President J.

The cars belong in the field as two of the fastest 33; however, starting on the tail of the field is the appropriate penalty in this instance.&rdquo;</p><p>IndyCar has also suspended the team strategists for both cars and fined each entry $100,000. They will also forfeit their qualifying points. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/scott-mclaughlin/829903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott McLaughlin</a>, who crashed in Sunday morning practice, did not take part in Fast 12 qualifying.</p><p>IndyCar officials still inspected the #3 car and said: "Upon review of the car, and IndyCar impounding the No. 3 attenuator, IndyCar found that the car was in fact using a legal and unmodified attenuator."</p><p>Boles added: &ldquo;The positive momentum around the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis 500 has been on a steep crescendo over the last several months, and we want it to be clear that our intent is to maintain that momentum and discourage teams from putting IndyCar in positions where it calls into the integrity of our officiating and the levelness of the playing field.</p><p>&ldquo;As we look to the remainder of the week and the race this weekend, we will do everything we can to make it clear that this is not only the best racing on the planet but racing where the best win under completely fair conditions.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Aussies rule after GB3's Dutch duels at Zandvoort ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Antipodean success was a key theme of GB3&rsquo;s annual visit to Zandvoort last weekend, with Patrick Heuzenroeder and Alex Ninovic among the winners and Australians heading the championship standings.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.autosport.com/national/news/slater-makes-a-statement-as-new-gb3-era-gets-under-way-at-silverstone/10717758/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silverstone dominator Freddie Slater</a> absent owing to Formula Regional European commitments, it was the turn of Xcel Motorsport&rsquo;s Heuzenroeder to deliver a star showing. The sophomore contender claimed his first series pole on Saturday, enjoying a margin of nearly four tenths of a second to the rest of the field in Q1, which determined the race-one grid.</p><p>Heuzenroeder made full use of his front-row advantage to hold the lead on lap one. After initially breaking clear of the one-second barrier, the key figure required for GB3&rsquo;s new DRS feature, Heuzenroeder had to contend with Hitech&rsquo;s Deagen Fairclough in the early stages as the Briton got back within that second range.</p><p>But Fairclough&rsquo;s challenge faded and David Brabham&rsquo;s protege streaked clear to claim the first GB3 win for both himself and Xcel Motorsport, over 6s ahead of Fairclough, who earned his first podium. Another Aussie, Rodin&rsquo;s Gianmarco Pradel took third, only two tenths behind Fairclough, while Ninovic plus Argenti with Prema duo Reza Seewooruthun and Yuanpu Cui were in the train behind.</p><p>Rodin&rsquo;s Ninovic was the next Australian to impress in race two. Having taken pole in the second qualifying segment, he held the lead at Turn 1, while Heuzenroeder blasted from third past a slow-starting Fairclough to take second. Fairclough was initially demoted to fourth, but dispatched Seewooruthun immediately at Turn 3.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/84478251-4793-ad34-4b82-d2630e.jpg" alt="Ninovic was another Australian to enjoy success in race two" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Ninovic was another Australian to enjoy success in race two</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: JEP</p><p>The lead trio soon broke away from the chasing pack, though Ninovic and Heuzenroeder were able to edge clear late on, with Ninovic claiming victory by just 0.6s while Fairclough was 3s further back in third. Seewooruthun continued his strong weekend with fourth ahead of Fairclough&rsquo;s team-mate Nikita Johnson, with Cui sixth again.</p><p>The top-12 reversal from the combined qualifying result put JHR&rsquo;s Kai Daryanani on pole for race three, but Elite&rsquo;s front-row starter Will Macintyre and VRD&rsquo;s Hugo Schwarze from fourth were able to move past on the first tour, with Schwarze then passing Macintyre after a mistake on lap two.</p><p>The race was then neutralised behind the safety car after Flynn Jackes went off at Turn 1 and, after green-flag running resumed for just a few seconds, the safety car was dispatched again when Pradel&rsquo;s Turn 3 lunge on Daryanani triggered a three-car collision. With the cars interconnected, the second safety car lasted much longer, and there was time for just two racing laps at the end of the contest.</p><p>Schwarze rebuffed Macintyre&rsquo;s threat behind to claim a first GB3 win in his second season, while Hitech&rsquo;s Keanu Al Azhari earned a breakthrough podium. Fairclough was a reversed-grid hero again as he carved from 11th to fourth, ahead of JHR&rsquo;s Noah Lisle, with Johnson sixth.</p><p>A seventh place capped off a superb weekend for new championship leader Heuzenroeder, with Ninovic and Lisle completing an Australian top three in the standings after six races. Fairclough is the only Briton in the top five, with yet another Aussie, Pradel, rounding out the lead quintet.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/bf4f1f54-dfff-bde4-8478-609edd.jpg" alt="VRD's Schwarze topped a truncated reversed-grid finale" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">VRD's Schwarze topped a truncated reversed-grid finale</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: JEP</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Why Albon was disappointed with P5 at F1 Imola GP after late Leclerc battle ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>After the first seven rounds of the 2024 Formula 1 season, <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/williams/36474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams</a> was one of two teams yet to score a point; <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> had broken its duck in Miami, leaving just the British squad and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/sauber/36476/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sauber</a> as those yet to register a top 10.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-albon/840486/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Albon</a> then got the team off the mark in Monaco with ninth, in a race spent tucked under Yuki Tsunoda's gearbox, as Williams continued to suffer the after-effects of building a FW46 that tipped the scales far beyond the minimum weight limit.</p><p>A year later, Albon has scored points in all but one of the seven grands prix so far in 2025, three of them amid the top five, as the Anglo-Thai racer has found excellent form with Williams' vastly improved 2025 package.</p><p>The metrics haven't entirely gone his own way; Albon trails new team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/carlos-sainz/829244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Sainz</a> 3-4 in their qualifying head-to-heads (sprint qualifying not included), but Sainz has endured less luck in the races and has often come off worse with strategic calls. The Spaniard's short opening stint at Imola set him back in traffic, resulting in a battle to climb back into the points.</p><p>Albon, for his part, admitted he was slightly disappointed with fifth owing to his late-race pace; he reckoned that, had he been a little more circumspect in battling <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/840485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a> in the final stint, he might have even started to ratchet up the pressure on third-placed <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.</p><p>"It's weird, isn't it?" Albon mused to Sky Sports F1 afterwards. "On a pure race, we were fighting for P3, P4, but that's no safety car, that's just a pure situation.</p><p>"Maybe we were a little bit lucky with the VSC, admittedly, but at the same time, got unlucky again on the last safety car. We've got back-to-back P5s and coming away today a bit disappointed, which is a bit strange to say.</p><p>"I think maybe could have raced Charles a bit differently, could have done a bit better there, obviously lost out to Lewis [Hamilton], and then maybe could have been a bit more patient with my overtake to Charles.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qX5NlE6/s1000/alex-albon-williams.jpg" alt="Alex Albon, Williams" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Alex Albon, Williams</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>"I was kind of honestly licking my lips, I thought I could even get Oscar up in front as well, such was the pace and the new tyres we had on the car."</p><h2>Albon steps up as Williams continues to raise 2025 form</h2><p>The ex-Red Bull driver has found excellent form in the races this season, often proving to be quicker than Sainz over the long-run stints. Across his time at Williams, he's proven to be adept at pulling together strong tyre management races, which offers the team a bit more strategic latitude - remember Australia 2022, where he did all but the final lap on the same set of tyres to clinch 10th?</p><p>Now that Williams is in a position to challenge regularly amid the middle reaches of the points, Albon is finally getting the plaudits he deserves &ndash; having spent much of his post-Red Bull career, he joined Williams in 2022, honing his craft amid the lower midfield.</p><p>But, per his comments about Imola, Albon feels that there's more available; Williams might not have the top-end pace needed to stick the car in the top four on the grid, but its slow-burn race pace has put the FW47 in the equation &ndash; even with little development work over the year.</p><p>And that's reassuring, even if Albon has had to pinch himself slightly; he's admitted to being slightly dubious about whether the Grove squad's performance will last &ndash; and hadn't expected to be particularly strong at Imola.</p><p>"It's a weird one," he said. "Honestly, I keep telling myself it won't happen again, and it's this race, and then we go to the next race, and we're still very quick again, and it's a bit like, is it circumstantial, is it not?</p><p>"I would honestly say Miami and here, we've been quick. In my opinion, almost unexpectedly quick this weekend; I expected Miami to be good, but not here, and it kind of opens the window for what else.</p><p>"Maybe next week [at Monte Carlo] we're going to be good. I actually think Monaco won't be too bad, I think Barcelona [the one after Monaco] we're going to struggle, but let's keep going, enjoying this while it lasts."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKE7vwr0/s1000/alex-albon-williams.jpg" alt="Alex Albon, Williams" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Alex Albon, Williams</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>Williams team principal James Vowles explained in a pre-Imola media session that the addition of Sainz was spurring Albon on to deliver his best &ndash; and that a genuinely collaborative relationship between the two has given both drivers a fresh perspective.</p><p>Explaining the team harmony, Vowles stated that although Albon had occasionally worried about the idea of Williams starting to favour Sainz, his non-political stance at the team has maintained that collaboration through the opening rounds.</p><p>"Alex, like any human being, needs to be pushed in order to get the absolute most out of them," Vowles said. "I don't know any elite athlete that is able to find the absolute limit by themselves, they need someone else to show them that a bit. So, first and foremost, that's it.</p><p>"We're now looking at the data, Alex is able to see two or three corners where Carlos is doing something slightly different, and they bounce off each other.</p><p>"Alex has no politics in him whatsoever at all, so it actually allows Carlos to be completely himself. He doesn't have to be worried about having a situation being thrown back against him.</p><p>"That's actually what caused part of the problem in Miami, he was worried that that was the circumstance and it's not whatsoever at all.</p><p>"With Alex, we've just got an individual who loves driving and racing cars fast and loves talking about it, and from the first meetings we had, Alex was telling everything to Carlos: 'Try this, do this, have a look at this, I did this in this corner and it'll help you get there.'</p><p>"That's not normal. Normally in teams, what you do is one of your drivers tries to hold that all back so you gain your advantage for a longer period of time."</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Ben Hunt</em></p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/analysis-the-data-behind-verstappens-impressive-overtake-on-piastri-at-imola/10724392/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/2wBNoQ30/s2/oscar-piastri-mclaren-max-vers-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Analysis: The data behind Verstappen's impressive overtake on Piastri at Imola</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ How Ogier pounced on Rally Portugal win that got away from Tanak ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Even Sebastien Ogier had to admit that on pure pace <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/ott-tanak/829695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ott Tanak</a> had him covered. It&rsquo;s not often the eight-time world champion utters such words.&nbsp;</p><p>This was Ogier&rsquo;s 63rd World Rally Championship career win, arriving at the same event that kicked off this incredible winning tally 15 years ago. Over the years Ogier has proved the master of racking up wins, and for the majority he&rsquo;s been the pacesetter, but in that time he&rsquo;s also learned &ldquo;it is not always about being quick in rallying". This was exactly the case in Portugal, as Ogier and co-driver <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/vincent-landais/863990/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Landais</a> survived 24 stages in what <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/ogier-rally-portugal-among-most-physically-demanding-of-wrc-career/10724208/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ogier declared as one of the most demanding rallies of his career</a> to eventually edge an unfortunate pacesetter Tanak by 8.7s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's something I can be really proud of, staying competitive for all these years,&rdquo; said 41-year-old Ogier. "I think we proved one more time that race management is definitely a craft we have.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a tough fight with Ott, unfortunately not fair to the end with his problem otherwise we would have not won, because he was obviously quicker. But it's not always about being quick in rallying, you also have to bring it home and that's what we did."</p><h2>Hyundai&rsquo;s response to Canary Islands defeat falls short</h2><p>The WRC may be more focused on out and out sprints compared to the marathons of the past, but in Portugal these two aspects were most definitely combined. Crews faced a more punishing schedule than in previous years, headlined by a 10-stage Friday leg, that drew criticism from drivers. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/rally-portugal-criticism-causes-wrc-fia-to-address-event-schedules/10724340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The FIA and WRC are working to improve this for future events</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Schedule aside, Portugal is very much a Toyota stronghold having been unbeaten since 2019 with Hyundai&rsquo;s last victory arriving in 2018, courtesy of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/thierry-neuville/829787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thierry Neuville</a>. While Ogier extended that Toyota dominance for another year, the Frenchman admitted that Toyota was &ldquo;missing some performance&rdquo; compared to Hyundai.</p><p>Desperate to bounce back from its crushing at the hands of Toyota in the Canary Islands last month, Hyundai started on the front foot in Portugal. Tanak and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/adrien-fourmaux/869791/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adrien Fourmaux</a> found themselves locked in an intense fight through Friday with the gap between the pair fluctuating between 0.2 and 0.8s. The pace in the I20 N was clearly there.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6zQGoK7Y/s1000/adrien-fourmaux-alexandre-cori.jpg" alt="Fourmaux started strongly for Hyundai but ultimately failed to make the finish" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Fourmaux started strongly for Hyundai but ultimately failed to make the finish</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>But by stage eight, Fourmaux&rsquo;s challenge came to an abrupt stop when his i20 N suffered a sudden front left suspension failure that forced the Frenchman into retirement, while an overheating engine curtailed a recovery on Sunday. World champion Neuville was fortunate to survive a spin in stage two on Friday, but couldn&rsquo;t regularly match the pace of his team-mates.</p><p>Tanak continued his charge, ending a brutal Friday by extending his lead to seven seconds over Ogier, who hauled himself to second. It set up a classic fight between Ogier and Tanak, one that seemed to be well and truly on when Ogier closed to within two seconds of Tanak after stage 12 on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>Overcoming a puncture, Tanak responded, finding a set-up tweak that made him the happiest he&rsquo;s been for a long time in the i20 N. Three stage wins followed, including a time 9.8s faster than Ogier that left his rival dumbstruck by the time loss.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was looking interesting but unfortunately something went really wrong for us in the last stage [on Saturday morning] and I don&rsquo;t really have any explanation for it because it didn&rsquo;t feel bad,&rdquo; said Ogier, clearly exhausted from the effects of the schedule.</p><blockquote><p>"You are only as strong as your weakest joint. That is the game. It is never only performance, it is never only reliability, it is the package. It is nothing to do with luck, we need to be stronger" <strong>Ott Tanak</strong></p></blockquote><p>Tanak knew the second pass through the stages would be rough. Just like in 2017 and 2021 when Tanak seemingly was on course for a victory, trouble struck in the Amarante stage. This time the despair came in the form of a power steering failure caused by broken steering rack casing. Co-driver Martin Jarvoeja engaged multi-tasking mode, calling notes and changing gears for Tanak who had to use every ounce of strength to wrestle the car through to the safety of service.&nbsp;&ldquo;Two times [in Amarante] we have had the victory kind of safe already, but that&rsquo;s the way it is,&rdquo; said Tanak, who dropped from the lead to third.</p><p>Ogier survived the rough and rutted stages to take the lead he held until the finish, proving that his rally management remains as strong as ever. The embrace with Tanak at the finish said it all. Ogier knew he wasn&rsquo;t the quickest but as the Frenchman said, it is not only about speed in the WRC. &ldquo;I think the wins nowadays need a harder fight to get them,&rdquo; said Ogier.</p><p>Tanak ended the rally with 12 stage&nbsp;wins and underlined that this was a victory that had slipped away by taking the maximum 10 points from Super Sunday. It was hard luck but that&rsquo;s not how Tanak sees it.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0k7aq1q0/s1000/sebastien-ogier-vincent-landai.jpg" alt="Tanak was denied in Portugal once again - but through no lack of pace which Ogier acknowledged" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Tanak was denied in Portugal once again - but through no lack of pace which Ogier acknowledged</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>&ldquo;Since Saturday after the first stage we got our balance in the window and then every stage the car was working nicely,&rdquo; said Tanak.&nbsp;&ldquo;All the things we have done have been positive for gravel but we need to do more things to be on the level with Toyota. Our weakness is still around these weak links and you are only as strong as your weakest joint. That is the game. It is never only performance, it is never only reliability, it is the package. It is nothing to do with luck, we need to be stronger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>Rovanpera still has work to do to find gravel form</h2><p>After demolishing the field on asphalt in the Canary Islands, Kalle Rovanpera definitely put his early season struggles understanding the Hankook tyres to bed on tarmac at least. The Finn knew after winning on the Spanish island that being fast on gravel was another story.</p><p>In testing before the event he admitted that he was yet to find his &ldquo;happy place&rdquo; on gravel and that narrative continued in Portugal. The two-time world champion has previously won this event twice but he was unable to replicate the speed that delivered wins in 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Rovanpera remained frustrated by a tyre he described as &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; and not reacting to his inputs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not comfortable with the tyres and can&rsquo;t have the normal flow that I would have. It is bothering me a bit,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>That being said, the Finn was still able to show his quality despite being hamstrung by this tyre conundrum. Despite starting second on the road, he was able to rise to third that soon became second after Tanak&rsquo;s power steering issue. There was even a brief moment when it appeared a charge for victory was about to ignite after winning stage 19, taking 11.1s out of Ogier&rsquo;s lead. "It didn't feel so good in the car, I don't know what the others are doing, but I think I could be much faster," said Rovanpera after the stage win.</p><p>But the struggles were clear to see as Tanak managed to overhaul Rovanpera, who had to settle for third, 12.2s behind Ogier.</p><p>"It has been a long and difficult weekend for us. Definitely a big disappointment that we did not have the pace even with the good starting position [on Sunday]. We are missing a lot of pace, I can't be faster than that. No grip and no pace on the car at the moment, so we have to keep working on it," he said.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6n9ZQyOY/s1000/kalle-rovanpera-jonne-halttune.jpg" alt="Rovanpera hasn't unlocked the sweetspot with Hankook's gravel tyres, but showed an upturn in form in Portugal compared to his last gravel outing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Rovanpera hasn't unlocked the sweetspot with Hankook's gravel tyres, but showed an upturn in form in Portugal compared to his last gravel outing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>Rovanpera closed the gap to Evans in the title race but will need to master these tyres on gravel if he wishes to maintain a championship challenge.</p><h2>Evans&rsquo; title tilt undergoes its first major test</h2><p>At one point championship leader <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/elfyn-evans/829817/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elfyn Evans</a> jokingly suggested that he&rsquo;d forgotten how to drive the car on gravel. Portugal was always going to be a test for Evans, facing the disadvantage of opening the roads as the WRC&rsquo;s traditional gravel season kicked off.</p><p>Evans found himself 1m09.0s adrift of the lead in seventh at the end of Friday while Rovanpera, who started second on the road, was fourth only 28.4s adrift. It was proof that it wasn&rsquo;t only road cleaning that Evans was struggling with. The Welshman said last year that rough gravel events were his weakness and it appears that remains the case.&nbsp;"I don&rsquo;t feel that bad in the car. We struggled at the start of the weekend but now it doesn&rsquo;t feel that bad and the push doesn&rsquo;t seem that steady but the times are miles away," said Evans on Saturday night.</p><blockquote><p>"It is hard to still take the positives at the moment, obviously we lacked speed as well as the challenge of the road position, and the two things together really were significant" <strong>Elfyn Evans</strong></p></blockquote><p>Evans attempted a change to his driving style on Sunday to see if that could alter his fortunes but to no avail. "I was just being a bit more aggressive at the turn in phase, but you can only do that so much, and where you need to be very precise and accurate I struggled," he added.</p><p>Sixth place was snatched from team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/sami-pajari/955317/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sami Pajari</a>, but with only nine points secured his championship lead was reduced from 43 to 30 points over Rovanpera.</p><p>"It is hard to still take the positives at the moment, obviously we lacked speed as well as the challenge of the road position, and the two things together really were significant," Evans added. "There is a bit of learning to do [with the tyre] but a lot of the challenges I have, have been there for a long time and I can&rsquo;t see to get on top of them, but they can&rsquo;t seem to offer much with the car to come towards my style either."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6b7d1Qw0/s1000/elfyn-evans-scott-martin-toyot.jpg" alt="Evans endured his own struggles on his way to a lowly sixth" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Evans endured his own struggles on his way to a lowly sixth</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><h2>M-Sport rookie McErlean makes a statement&nbsp;</h2><p>Josh McErlean said on the eve of the 2025 season that this year would be a baptism of fire having been thrusted into M-Sport&rsquo;s Rally1 line-up. The rookie has shown flashes of pace in the four previous events but in Portugal he delivered his most impressive showing yet.</p><p>The Irishman had the least experience on gravel driving the Puma compared to team-mates <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/gregoire-munster/953238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregoire Munster</a> and Martins Seeks, but came out comfortably on top to finish a credible eighth, 45.2s ahead of a frustrated Munster.&nbsp;"Honestly, it's been a really nice weekend, we loved every moment of it. Crazy rally as always, so nice to come to the finish and have some good times as well," said McErlean.</p><p>Granted, it proved to be a challenging round for rising star Martins Sesks as a puncture on stage two cost the Latvian three minutes before picking up a further three-minute penalty for starting stage seven late. But there were flashes of pace from Sesks as his learning curve continues.</p><h2>Portugal&rsquo;s new hero embodied the nation&rsquo;s rally passion&nbsp;</h2><p>While there were plenty of drivers questioning Rally Portugal&rsquo;s itinerary, nobody can question the nation&rsquo;s passion for rallying. For a country that has never produced a world champion, the fascination with the WRC is perhaps only rivalled at the moment by Finland and Kenya.</p><p>An estimated 500,000 spectators enjoyed the rally packing into stages and lining road sections creating an incredible atmosphere. More importantly there were no delays or cancelled stages due to crowd numbers as organisers did an excellent job ensuring the event ran smoothly.</p><p>The weekend did create a new Portuguese hero that has picked up an army of fans. Step forward Diogo Salvi. The 55-year-old businessman piloted a fourth M-Sport Ford Puma Rally1 in what was his first taste of rallying&rsquo;s top level, having regularly competed in WRC2 at his home round since 2014. Salvi typified a persona similar to British ski jumper Eddie &ldquo;the Eagle&rdquo; Edwards. He was slow but lived out his rally dreams. He endeared himself to the rally community with an infectious laugh and memorable stage-end interviews that culminated with a speech at the end of the rally.&nbsp;</p><p>"What a party, I enjoyed it. Very slow, but I enjoyed it. Now let's go, [co-driver] Axel [Coronado]. Very professional, very talented, magnificent job, incredible patience to support me. Second, let's go to M-Sport. All the guys, they did tremendous work. Richard [Millener], you can be proud of your team and give them a raise," he said, before issuing another chuckle to himself.</p><p>"Last but not least, my family. They were always complaining, no more three hours of waiting for me and also thanks to the love of my life for taking care of the children. She hates rallies, but tonight I will give her a dinner."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99kqaZY/s1000/diogo-salvi-axel-coronado-m-sp.jpg" alt="Salvi embodied the spirit of rally as a surprise new home hero" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Salvi embodied the spirit of rally as a surprise new home hero</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: M-Sport</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Analysis: The data behind Verstappen's impressive overtake on Piastri at Imola ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> laid the foundations for his fourth consecutive victory at Formula 1&rsquo;s Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in the first chicane.</p><p>Although the Red Bull driver suffered a relatively poor start, with even <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> momentarily passing him, Verstappen was first by the end of Turn 3 after a brilliant overtake on <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"At one point, I was in third on the straight. That wasn&rsquo;t ideal of course, but then I just braked a bit later than all the others!" Verstappen laughed when he looked back at his own overtake.</p><p>He outbraked Piastri heading into the Tamburello chicane to move around the outside of the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>, squeezing his way past into a lead that Verstappen subsequently never lost.</p><p>So, what is the data behind it?</p><h2>Verstappen's car positioning: Giving Norris and Russell no chance</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/24vxqvP6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>It&rsquo;s easier said than done. Verstappen&rsquo;s move, in reality, was far more complex than his words suggest.</p><p>The world champion emphasised that it was crucial to stay on the racing line, where there was more grip and it was less bumpy compared to the inside line. It was the first step in his successful attempt and, interestingly, mirrors another memorable Verstappen overtaking manoeuvre during a first lap: Mexico 2021.</p><p>Back then, Verstappen was on the outside as well, as he took advantage of the extra grip on the racing line, and managed to brake later than <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/valtteri-bottas/829609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valtteri Bottas</a> and, most crucially, his fierce title rival <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a>.</p><p>At Imola, Russell concluded post-race that Piastri had simply left the door open on the outside. It is true, but only tells one part of the story.</p><p>The other part is how Verstappen positioned his car, as the reigning world champion did it cleverly. After the slow start, he immediately looked both right and left in his mirrors to see where Russell and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> were.</p><p>Verstappen positioned the car in such a way that Russell couldn&rsquo;t come across, ensuring that the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> driver could not block the outside line for the Dutchman. At the same time, he left just under a car&rsquo;s width of space on the right side of the track, preventing Norris from diving into that gap.</p><p>This way, Verstappen maintained control of his own racing line and kept the outside line &ndash; essentially the ideal racing line &ndash; entirely for himself, allowing him to initiate his late braking manoeuvre.</p><h2>The numbers align with Piastri&rsquo;s words: A 10-metre difference</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0JB3KBN0/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>Regarding that late-braking move, the top speeds that Verstappen and Piastri reached at the end of the straight were nearly identical. The Red Bull driver hit 289 km/h during the acceleration phase after the start, while Piastri reached 288 km/h.</p><p>However, the McLaren driver lifted off the throttle earlier than Verstappen. The data and telemetry show that Verstappen kept his right foot fully pressed to the floor for 10 metres longer than Piastri.</p><p>The championship leader also slowed down more gradually, as Piastri lifted off much earlier than his Red Bull rival, but Verstappen, after that, slammed on the brakes sooner.</p><p>As a result, Verstappen entered the braking zone nearly 30 km/h faster than Piastri. At the moment Verstappen began braking from his highest recorded speed (289 km/h), Piastri&rsquo;s speed was already at 260 km/h due to the earlier lift.</p><p>It&rsquo;s this nearly 30 km/h difference when entering the braking zone &ndash; seen in the image below, with Verstappen being the yellow line and Piastri the orange &ndash; that Verstappen was able to carry into the corner.</p><p>Or, as he put it: "When I braked late and then released the brake pedal, I thought 'okay, maybe this move is on&rsquo;. So, I decided to carry that extra speed, and with that, you obviously get the momentum."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2wBNowe0/s1000/max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-i.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen Oscar Piastri Imola Turn 1 Data" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen Oscar Piastri Imola Turn 1 Data</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Tracing Insights</p><p>Although Verstappen slowed down quicker due to his aggressive braking, the speed difference was still more than 15 km/h when he fully positioned his RB21 next to Piastri &ndash; 184 vs. 168 km/h.</p><p>At the slowest point of the first chicane, the speed of the Red Bull driver was still slightly higher than Piastri. Verstappen&rsquo;s speed at the slowest point of Tamburello was 140 km/h, while Piastri&rsquo;s was 136 km/h.</p><p>After that, both drivers accelerated more or less simultaneously, but Piastri had to do so in two phases. The Australian, according to telemetry, had to lift off a bit more than Verstappen again - logically because Verstappen had claimed the corner by then and was on what was originally the outside line, but later became the inside.</p><p>The numbers perfectly align with what Piastri himself explained afterwards. The McLaren driver took the first chicane in a fairly standard, cautious way by lifting off early - he thought it would do as he had the inside line covered.</p><p>When asked if he was surprised by Verstappen's move around the outside, Piastri replied in the post-race press conference: "Yeah. I thought I had it pretty under control, and it was a good move from Max. So, I&rsquo;ll learn for next time, clearly."</p><p>His response to the question about what he would do differently, also matches the data and telemetry: "Of course, I would do something different. I think I would brake about 10 metres later." This corresponds to the 10 metres he lifted off the throttle earlier and is exactly what led to the 30 km/h speed difference that Verstappen carried into the corner.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2d1kp3ZY/s1000/max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-i.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, Imola Turn 1 Telemetry" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, Imola Turn 1 Telemetry</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Tracing Insights</p><p>Together with the ideal racing line with more grip, mainly the result of how Verstappen positioned his car on the straight, gave him the momentum to complete what <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/how-max-verstappens-win-it-or-bin-it-move-won-red-bulls-400th-race-in-f1/10724236/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Horner has called "a win it or bin it move"</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s exactly what, combined with Red Bull's surprisingly good race pace, has earned Verstappen his second victory of the 2025 season. Or as the four-time world champion summed it up himself: "A move like this is never easy, but luckily, everything went well."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/go-hard-or-go-home-we-should-applaud-verstappen-seizing-the-moment/10724249/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0JB3KBN0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Go hard or go home: We should applaud Verstappen seizing the moment at Imola GP</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Who is Albert Valera? The agent at the centre of the MotoGP rider market ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Following the news that <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/martin-pushing-to-exit-aprilia-contract-early-manufacturer-considering-legal-action/10722045/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Martin intends to leave Aprilia at the end of the year</a>, Albert Valera, the Spaniard&rsquo;s agent, has become the name on everyone&rsquo;s lips in the MotoGP paddock. But who is the man holding the keys to shake up the MotoGP rider market?</p><p>At 40 years old, this native of the Maresme region - a coastal area north of Barcelona - looks after the interests of both Jorge Martin and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/pedro-acosta/875346/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pedro Acosta</a>, another rising star likely to make headlines in the coming days. Acosta&rsquo;s future remains uncertain until KTM, his current team, resolves the financial puzzle it&rsquo;s entangled in.</p><p>Despite his current influence in the championship, Valera never intended to become a rider agent. His entrance into the role was purely accidental, brought about by a chance encounter with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jorge-lorenzo/829258/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Lorenzo</a> just as Valera was planning to move to Australia.</p><p>The connection between them was Ricky Cardus, a mutual friend who now manages Rocco&rsquo;s Ranch, the motocross circuit next to Montmelo where much of the MotoGP grid trains. It was in 2012 when Lorenzo felt he needed a change in his professional circle. &ldquo;I had a good relationship with Albert through Ricky. He always struck me as a sharp guy, and I was impressed by how well he expressed himself. At that time, I wanted to change my entourage. One day, I invited him to a restaurant in Barcelona and proposed that we start working together,&rdquo; Lorenzo told Autosport.</p><p>Valera picks up the start of their partnership as his entry into the rider agent role.</p><p>&ldquo;I had never even considered representation. In fact, when Jorge brought it up, I was working at Johnson &amp; Johnson. I had just graduated with a degree in Business Administration and was planning to go abroad to study for an MBA. But then Jorge came along and everything changed,&rdquo; Valera said.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6n9ZmdmY/s1000/albert-valera-riders-and-footb.jpg" alt="Albert Valera speaks with Massimo Rivola, Aprilia Sports Director" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Albert Valera speaks with Massimo Rivola, Aprilia Sports Director</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Mirco Lazzari GP - Getty Images</p><p>Lorenzo was impressed instantly by Valera when he secured their first deal, which saw the Spaniard remain at Yamaha on a new two-year deal back in 2012.</p><p>&ldquo;Albert is a very intelligent and honest guy who&rsquo;s not driven by money. The first deal we signed worked well for both of us. His commission was lower than what other riders had agreed to pay their agents, but at that time, I was moving the biggest sums in the paddock,&rdquo; Lorenzo adds, recalling Valera&rsquo;s debut race as his representative. &ldquo;It was at Assen, and he already had to deal with Lin Jarvis there, in what turned out to be a pretty tense meeting.&rdquo;</p><p>Valera also helped negotiate Lorenzo&rsquo;s big-money deal with Ducati for the 2017 season, which earned the Mallorcan around &euro;25million over two years. By then, Valera&rsquo;s client list had already expanded to include <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/aleix-espargaro/829595/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aleix Espargaro</a> since 2013 and Jorge Martin since 2014.</p><p>This growth led to the expansion of Playmaker, the agency Valera founded to support his clients with full services. Beyond legal and financial experts, the agency also brought in communications specialists, such as Artur Vilalta - now Ducati&rsquo;s communications director - and Marc Balsells, Valera&rsquo;s current right-hand man.</p><p>Valera is now seen by some as the agent who pulls off the impossible. He managed to free Martin from KTM at the end of 2020 thanks to a clause he had included in the contract.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0oOzyBx0/s1000/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te.jpg" alt="Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Gold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images</p><p>A similar clause is now causing trouble for Aprilia.</p><p>Back then, the delayed start of the season due to COVID-19 allowed Martin to sign with Ducati and make his MotoGP debut with Pramac in 2021. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/martin-pushing-to-exit-aprilia-contract-early-manufacturer-considering-legal-action/10722045/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Autosport revealed last week</a>, a similar clause is in Martin&rsquo;s contract with Aprilia, but the manufacturer considers it invalid because the rider missed five of the first six races of the year.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, wounds like the one KTM suffered when Jorge left take time to heal,&rdquo; Valera said. &ldquo;But eventually, they do. As much as possible, I try to keep these matters from becoming personal. I understand why KTM was upset back then, and I also understand why the current situation is uncomfortable for Aprilia. But all I&rsquo;m doing is trying to create the best possible scenario for my riders.&rdquo;</p><p>In the coming weeks, he may face two high-stakes negotiations if Acosta also decides to leave KTM before his contract ends in order to join the VR46&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/ducati-team/36509/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ducati team</a>, which would welcome him with open arms.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/why-the-conflict-between-martin-and-aprilia-is-a-bad-deal-for-both-parties/10722655/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YKED7ab0/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Why Martin vs Aprilia conflict will have no easy resolution</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/whats-driving-jorge-martins-aprilia-escape-plot/10722203/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0k7WaRA0/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">What's driving Jorge Martin's Aprilia escape plot?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Legendary performances as Knockhill celebrates 50 years of car racing ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>A record grid of 30 Scottish Legends put on a spectacular show at Knockhill last weekend as the Fife circuit celebrated a half-century of car racing in fine style.</p><p>Basking in perfect sunshine and ambient temperatures upwards of 20 degrees, the two-day meeting produced action and drama befitting of such a significant anniversary, with Legends championship protagonists Ben Mason and Daniel Clark taking a heat and final win apiece. But it was Clark who left happiest after taking a large chunk out of his 195-point pre-meeting deficit to Mason to give his title tilt a much-needed shot in the arm.</p><p>Clark finished second to Michael Weddell in a stop-start Saturday opener as mechanical woes caused Mason to retire. Things were even worse for Mason&rsquo;s erstwhile nearest rival Ryan McLeish, who scored zero points after a blown engine during the morning&rsquo;s familiarisation session ruled him out of the entire weekend.</p><p>Mason recovered from his race-one disappointment to win the reversed-grid second encounter by just over a tenth of a second from Clark, following a late lunge on his rival at the Hairpin just as the double waved yellows had been removed for an earlier incident. Mason&rsquo;s form continued in dominating fashion as he charged through from 14th to take victory in the final by nearly six seconds from Colin Atkinson, profiting from an early safety car intervention.</p><p>&ldquo;The restart helped me stay close to the front and, once I got there, I just put my head down and used the clear air in front of me,&rdquo; Mason said.</p><p>The 10-lap affair was a race of attrition with no fewer than eight retirements, most notably Clark who was forced out with front-end damage. His wife Elby had looked on course to secure a maiden podium, but she too was a retirement after spinning out late on.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/masonweddell.jpg" alt="Mason and Weddell clashed late on in the final race of the weekend" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Mason and Weddell clashed late on in the final race of the weekend</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jim Moir</p><p>If Saturday had been entertaining, the following day&rsquo;s action raised the bar even higher as Matthew Pape beat Chris Grieve in a sensational opening bout in which the top four finishers were covered by under half a second over the line. Mason could only finish 24th after a penultimate-lap clash with Brent Bowie, while Daniel Clark bagged more points with sixth.</p><p>Clark then cruised to victory in heat two and also came out on top in a dramatic final, which came to a head on the last tour as Mason and Weddell came to blows while disputing second at McIntyres. The contact forced Weddell out and significantly delayed polesitter and long-time leader Elby Clark, dropping her to 19th by the end. Mason limited the damage by taking second ahead of Maxim Popelyushko.</p><p>The Scottish C1 Cup title fight remains deadlocked as Ayden Wilson and James Hitchen again shared the victories in a pair of closely-fought races. Hitchen led early doors in the opener and did well to fend off Wilson&rsquo;s initial attacks before the latter eventually found a way by after going side by side with Hitchen into the Chicane. That squabbling allowed Gregor McPhaden and James McCracken to close up towards the end.</p><p>Liam Kelso started the partially reversed-grid second race from pole but lost out to Henry Gillespie before the first corner as both Hitchen and Wilson made gains. Indeed, it wasn&rsquo;t long before Hitchen seized the lead from Gillespie with a superb dive at McIntyres. From there, Hitchen held a largely comfortable 2.4s advantage over Wilson to end the weekend tied on points in the standings once more.</p><p>Jack Irvine prevailed in one of the closest Scottish Mini Cooper Cup finishes ever, edging out Chad Little in a mesmerising drag to the finale&rsquo;s flag by three thousandths of a second. The Northern Irishman got a superb getaway off the line from fourth to lie second by the end of the first lap before completing his surge to the front of the field by slicing past Ralph Sturrock at Duffus. From there, Irvine knew he had to hold on somehow as Little reduced a 1.5s gap to nothing by the final corner. The pair bashed door panels on the run to the line, with a relieved Irvine just emerging as the winner.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/jack-irvine.jpg" alt="Irvine won third Mini race by the very narrowest of margins" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Irvine won third Mini race by the very narrowest of margins</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jim Moir</p><p>&ldquo;My front tyres went off, so I was struggling at Clarks and the Hairpin,&rdquo; recalled Irvine. &ldquo;It was so close; I didn&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;d won until I got back to the paddock!&rdquo;</p><p>Daniel Patterson won the opening two Cooper races and finished fourth in the final to boost his championship hopes, while Ross Wilkinson went unopposed in the Cooper S class.</p><p>Ron Cumming won two of the three Scottish Modsports races in his Nemesis Kit Car, which was given a run for its money by Jake Simpson&rsquo;s Radical SR8. Cumming&rsquo;s prowess through lapped traffic enabled the 76-year-old to stave off sustained pressure from Simpson in race one, and it was a similar story in the second encounter. With Cumming electing to sit out the third and final race, Simpson won at a canter by some 34s from the ex-Scandinavian Touring Car BMW silhouette of Paul Brydon. Completing the overall podium was the class D winner, racing novice Michael Barron in his Honda Civic.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Scottish Classic Sports &amp; Saloons, MG dominated proceedings as Alastair Baptie and Alasdair Coates put on a superb display in their MGB GTs to split the wins. Coates looked to have snatched victory from a touring Baptie in race one only to give his rival the win by spinning at the Hairpin on the last lap. Coates made no mistake in race two, despite pressure from the triple champion towards the end. Colin Calder claimed a pair of well-earned podiums in his nimble Ginetta G4.</p><p>Defending Scottish Fiesta ST Cup champion Gerry Hendry continued his unbeaten run at the start of the 2025 season, taking both wins ahead of David Colville, with Arran Ward and Jamie Dickie each taking the final step on the podium.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/gerry-hendry-1.jpg" alt="Reigning champion Hendry maintained his unbeaten start to Scottish Fiesta campaign" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Reigning champion Hendry maintained his unbeaten start to Scottish Fiesta campaign</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jim Moir</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Why race control opted for VSC, then safety car, in F1 Imola GP ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix featured two situations that initially looked similar but were handled differently by Formula 1&rsquo;s race control.</p><p>On lap 29, <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/esteban-ocon/840488/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esteban Ocon</a> suffered a technical issue on his Haas car and parked it on the grass between Turns 7 and 8.</p><p>Race control deployed the virtual safety car, which allows it to neutralise the race with drivers having to slow down, so that marshals could take the stricken car to a safe location. This process is shorter than a regular safety car and roughly maintains gaps between drivers.</p><p>In Ocon&rsquo;s case, marshals were able to intervene swiftly for two reasons. First, the Frenchman stopped close enough to an opening in the guardrail, making things easy. But most importantly, this was the first car to retire at this particular spot. In those conditions, it took some 3m40s to complete the VSC procedure.</p><p>Fast-forward to lap 46, and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/andrea-kimi-antonelli/953410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrea Kimi Antonelli</a> too was stricken by a mechanical problem on his <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a>. Like Ocon, the Italian rookie stopped on the grass, but closer to Turn 8. That time, race control opted for a regular safety car, which raised a few eyebrows.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99kqlqY/s1000/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-andrea-.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>Were they trying to revive a race that had been dominated by <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> thus far?</p><p>The reason why they proceeded this way is simple: one of the closest ways out of the circuit, for the car, was where Ocon&rsquo;s Haas was already stored, and there was no room for a second one.</p><p>Another option was located between Turns 8 and 9, but the track goes uphill in this particular section, so the use of a recovery vehicle was required to take the Mercedes there &ndash; which justified the safety car.</p><p>A safety car intervention takes longer than a VSC with several phases: the safety car coming on track, the field bunching up behind it, and once the track is clear, the possibility for backmarkers &ndash; in this case <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oliver-bearman/876509/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oliver Bearman</a> &ndash; to overtake their way back into the lead lap.</p><p>As a consequence, between the moment when the safety car was deployed and the moment when the end of the procedure was announced, about 14 minutes &ndash; and eight laps &ndash; went by.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/emilia-romagna-grand-prix-driver-ratings-2025/10724351/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQRK9MY/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Driver Ratings 2025</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/go-hard-or-go-home-we-should-applaud-verstappen-seizing-the-moment/10724249/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0JB3KBN0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Go hard or go home: We should applaud Verstappen seizing the moment at Imola GP</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ McLaren's F1 drivers may prioritise "self-interest", claims Horner ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Red Bull boss Christian Horner has hinted that McLaren's position in both Formula 1 world championships, with two drivers in the mix, will likely lead to 'self-interest outweighing team interest' &ndash; which could hurt the Woking squad.</p><p>Horner remarked on the two McLarens battling over second at the end of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, as <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> pitted under a late-race safety car which brought him out behind team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> let the pair race rather than call for Piastri to move aside, allowing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a>&nbsp;to maintain his lead at the front of the field and disappear out of sight once more.</p><p>Norris eventually dispatched his team-mate, but it was a close-run battle at Tamburello as Piastri defended the inside line into Turn 2; Horner praised both drivers for avoiding contact.</p><p>"Oscar had obviously pushed quite hard early on and you could see he was starting to get a little bit of graining on that front-right," Horner said of McLaren's race strategy.</p><p>"And so, it was borderline whether it was going to be a two-stop or one-stop. They obviously pulled the trigger on the two-stop, but it dropped you out because of the length of the pitlane here being 27 seconds.</p><p>"It put him into a world of pain traffic-wise. And so Max was then able to keep running and the deg was super low. And even with Lando in clean air behind, we were able to manage quite easily a nine-, nine-and-a-half-second gap.</p><p>"The VSC came out, and the pitstop was pretty straightforward. Oscar pitted again on his strategy, which sort of neutralised him, but by that time he'd used both of his hard tyres.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/63vbWegY/s1000/safety-car.jpg" alt="Safety car" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Safety car</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>"And then that final safety car, obviously Max pitted, Lando pitted, but it dropped him behind Oscar, which was, you know, you've got two drivers that are fighting for a world championship.</p><p>"At some point, self-interest will always outweigh team interest. That's the conflict. So, they did a good job to not make contact. It was commendable that they were allowed to race, but you could see it got pretty close."</p><p>Horner believed that, on the day, Red Bull had the much stronger pace over the Imola race following the team's steady build-up through the weekend.</p><p>He was encouraged by the team's performance, particularly Verstappen's blend of competitive lap times and management on the tyres.</p><p>"I think today we had the pace to cover whatever they could throw at us," Horner added.</p><p>"I think the first stint was really encouraging because we could see that [Verstappen] was managing more than the guys behind. So, he was driving very smartly and still pulling out a gap.</p><p>"And that's always a happy place to be in. So, you get the longevity. And it's the first time in quite a while that we've been in that position."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/emilia-romagna-grand-prix-driver-ratings-2025/10724351/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQRK9MY/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Driver Ratings 2025</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/go-hard-or-go-home-we-should-applaud-verstappen-seizing-the-moment/10724249/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0JB3KBN0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Go hard or go home: We should applaud Verstappen seizing the moment at Imola GP</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A fabulous three-way battle in the dry and dusty forests of North Wales was won by David Crossen in round three of the British Historic Rally Championship last weekend.</p><p>The Plains Rally featured a mighty contest between Crossen/Ben Teggart, David Henderson/Chris Lees and Dan Mennell/John Roberts as the three Ford Escort Mk2s battled furiously across the dustiest stages experienced for several years on the Bala-based event.</p><p>Ultimately, Crossen won by just five seconds despite a quick spin on the Dyfnant stage as Henderson took the runner-up spot just three seconds ahead of Mennell. The three crews were incredibly evenly-matched and were covered by a single second in the final stage, a 5.6-mile charge up and over the hills of Aberhirnant.</p><p>With George Lepley's Mitsubishi Galant VR4 out after the turbo ingested a stone and Seb Perez retiring his Porsche 911 with suspension damage, the three Escorts were left clear to battle across seven special stages.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/danmennell.jpg" alt="Bag of frozen peas helped ease Mennell's wrist pain as he took another podium" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Bag of frozen peas helped ease Mennell's wrist pain as he took another podium</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Paul Lawrence</p><p>Of the three drivers, only Henderson had any prior experience in the area and that was very limited. But their pace on stages where dust was hanging in the trees was outstanding.</p><p>Ultimately, it was Crossen who marginally had the edge to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/national/news/crossen-is-latest-first-time-bhrc-winner-with-carlisle-stages-triumph/10713560/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take his second BHRC win in a row</a>&nbsp;and underscore his credentials for a serious title campaign with three rounds still to run. &ldquo;Two wins on the trot is very good for us,&rdquo; said the Belfast driver.</p><p>Henderson, who continues his build-up towards November&rsquo;s Roger Albert Clark Rally, added: &ldquo;That's been a great day.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Mennell was right there in third despite hurting his wrist when it was caught in the steering wheel. He was able to carry on with support from a bag of frozen peas bought in a village ship on the route between stages. &ldquo;What a mint day,&rdquo; said Mennell. &ldquo;That's one of the best days rallying ever!&rdquo;</p><p>Adam Milner and Roy Jarvis overcame two broken wheels to win Category 2 in their 1600cc Escort Mk1 and Baz Jordan/Arwel Jenkins won Category 4 in their Galant. Milner and Jordan continue to lead the overall BHRC points as the schedule now switches to asphalt for the Argyll Rally in south-west Scotland on 20-21 June.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Rally Portugal criticism causes WRC & FIA to address event schedules ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The World Rally Championship and the FIA are working to address future event schedules after Rally Portugal&rsquo;s extreme itinerary drew widespread criticism from drivers.</p><p>Last weekend&rsquo;s round featured a revised schedule from the event organisers, which included two more stages compared to last year and was signed off by the FIA.</p><p>It meant crews tackled 10 stages on Friday beginning with a first test at 7:35am before eventually returning back to the Porto service park at 9pm.</p><p>Across the day drivers and co-drivers spent 14 hours in their cars covering a total distance of 683 kilometres, of which 146km were competitive stages. The day was only punctuated by two 20-minute remote services and two short regroups restricting drivers on time to eat and rest.</p><p>The action resumed on Saturday with the first car checking out of the service park at 6am, ahead of another 13-hour day. Sunday featured six stages, instead of the four witnessed last year, with crews starting the first test at 6:43am.&nbsp;</p><p>Drivers welcome long days in the championship that add to the challenge of events. But the short Friday night to recover and analyse onboard videos to prepare for Saturday&rsquo;s action, and the cumulative knock-on effect of the three days combined left many questioning the format.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/01WVOODY/s1000/kalle-rovanpera-jonne-halttune.jpg" alt="Kalle Rovanper&auml;, Jonne Halttunen, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Kalle Rovanper&auml;, Jonne Halttunen, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Toyota Racing</p><p>Speaking during a live television interview, Kalle Rovanpera stated the schedule posed a safety risk for crews, while rally winner Sebastien Ogier admitted it was among the most physically demanding contests of his career and felt changes to the future schedules would be required.</p><p>The rally once again drew huge crowds throughout the event running without incident, but the WRC Promoter has conceded that it hit some limits which will be addressed by new guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"The itinerary for the 2025 Vodafone Rally Portugal was designed to create a unique challenge within the 2025 WRC season - and for sure it has achieved that,&rdquo; read a statement from WRC Promoter.&nbsp;</p><p>"But we also believe that it has likely hit some limits for the length of consecutive days that can be sustained.</p><p>&ldquo;It's for this reason that the FIA and WRC Promoter have drafted some guidelines for the limits on working hours for people working in teams and the event organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;These are being considered by all stakeholder groups now, and we hope to reach a regulatory framework that considers all requirements in the coming months.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6n9ZmmMY/s1000/elfyn-evans-scott-martin-toyot.jpg" alt="Elfyn Evans, Scott Martin, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Elfyn Evans, Scott Martin, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Toyota Racing</p><p>Prior to the rally, the matter of working hours and pressure for those working in the WRC was discussed during the latest WRC Commission after the championship&rsquo;s promoter conducted a report into the matter.</p><p>It was agreed that a set of guidelines would be produced &ldquo;for event organisers to better advise and inform on improving practices when creating itineraries and the schedule of rally week&rdquo;.</p><p>The target is for these guidelines to be in place from next year. Reacting to the statement from the WRC, championship leader <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/elfyn-evans/829817/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elfyn Evans</a>, said: &ldquo;It has been brought up in so many meetings for years and nobody is doing anything about it.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it has come to something as completely extreme as this for people to start listening or realising there is an issue.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not just drivers, it is everyone, it is TV crews, it is marshals, teams and mechanics as well.</p><p>&ldquo;The mechanics are not working all day, but they are still travelling to these remote services and they are at the service park at 4am and they have to stay at the flexi service until midnight. It is too much.&rdquo;</p><h2>Why Friday&rsquo;s leg was increased</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99kqaZY/s1000/diogo-salvi-axel-coronado-m-sp.jpg" alt="Diogo Salvi, Axel Coronado, M-Sport Ford World Rally Team Ford Puma Rally1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Diogo Salvi, Axel Coronado, M-Sport Ford World Rally Team Ford Puma Rally1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: M-Sport</p><p>The FIA has explained that adding a longer Friday leg was a key factor in delivering the funding for this year&rsquo;s event - but admitted it is not a feature it would agree to for all rallies.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The itinerary included two new stages this year, which made Friday a longer day than usual for everybody,&rdquo; said FIA sporting delegate Timo Rautiainen in the FIA&rsquo;s rally review document.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s something that needs to be done in Portugal because there is a reliance on including as many municipalities as possible within the route to support the rally and make it happen.</p><p>&ldquo;A mammoth Friday made for a strong opening to the rally and we kept all but one of the P1 crews in the game. The crew that did retire was due to an unfortunate mechanical issue that can occur on any rally.</p><p>&ldquo;We also look to the event organisers to freshen up their routes and, while it&rsquo;s not a rule, it&rsquo;s always nice for at least 20% of the route to be renewed yearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, we would not look to include a day as long as Friday on every round of the championship, but a day like this in Portugal can work."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/ogier-rally-portugal-among-most-physically-demanding-of-wrc-career/10724208/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0L1NVrW2/s2/sebastien-ogier-toyota-gazoo-r.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Ogier: Rally Portugal among most physically demanding of WRC career</a><a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/wrc-portugal-sebastien-ogier-claims-record-extending-win/10724088/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/254MEbk0/s2/sebastien-ogier-vincent-landai-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">WRC Portugal: Sebastien Ogier extends record with another win</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ From 500bhp Mini-Honda to Longhurst-liveried BMW 325 - Pembrey BARC highlights ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <h2>Star car: Wade&rsquo;s 500bhp Mini-Honda</h2><p>For Classic Thunder racer Neil Wade, last weekend&rsquo;s triple-header at Pembrey was &ldquo;the first time I&rsquo;ve actually felt like I could drive&rdquo; his self-built 500bhp Honda turbo-powered Mini Cooper S R50.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a long process for the former Royal Air Force engineer who has returned to racing after a five-year hiatus. Wade&rsquo;s heavily-modified Mini previously had Saab motivation &ndash; a legacy of his rallycross days where the Swedish powerplant was a popular weapon of choice &ndash; but gearbox trouble was a constant source of frustration.</p><p>Initially sidelined by the pandemic, Wade intended to return in 2022 but his hopes were dashed by an engine blow-up and fire in testing. &ldquo;I went: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not doing Saabs anymore&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. His first Honda K20 fared no better, throwing a conrod after just a few laps of Snetterton. But a race-prepped version built by Clockwise Motion has combined power with reliability. Breathing through a Garrett GT3076 turbocharger and running a Haltech ECU, the Mini&rsquo;s motor can now do justice to Wade&rsquo;s chassis.</p><p>&ldquo;It took me 18 months to build,&rdquo; said Wade. &ldquo;I designed everything myself &ndash; all the suspension, built all the subframes [front and rear]. It has double wishbone suspension, all on rose joints with coilovers on the top.</p><p>&ldquo;The body kit I built out of wood in the garage and then took all the moulds off, learned how to do fibreglass, built all the panels, learned how to spray, and sprayed it!&rdquo;</p><p>After ironing out teething issues and dialling in the car over the season&rsquo;s first two rounds, Wade suffered another setback when his power-steering failed in qualifying at Pembrey &ndash; but it proved to be a blessing in disguise.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d even be able to race it with no power-steering [but] the car feels so much better without,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I can feel what it&rsquo;s doing, so it&rsquo;s not going back in it and we can get rid of about 10-15kg.&rdquo;</p><p>Three class wins were the reward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy,&rdquo; he beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got quicker and quicker and the racing was top notch, side by side, fantastic racing.&rdquo;</p><h2>Star car: The Nardones&rsquo; BMW 325</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/nardone-1.jpg" alt="The brothers wanted to stand out from the traditional BMW liveries and adopted a colour scheme inspired by Longhurst" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">The brothers wanted to stand out from the traditional BMW liveries and adopted a colour scheme inspired by Longhurst</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Jones</p><p>The Cardiff-based Nardone brothers took their newly re-liveried Tony Longhurst tribute car for a successful outing among the Pre-&rsquo;93 Touring Cars at their local circuit.</p><p>Luca Nardone usually shares the BMW 325 E30 with his elder brother Cristiano when the pair contest the Classic Sports Car Club&rsquo;s 40-minute Future Classics races. But he drove solo en route to a hat-trick of class wins in the Classic Touring Car Racing Club&rsquo;s 15-minute sprints while Cristiano shook down their Ford Mustang in the Pre-&rsquo;66 category.</p><p>The alloy wheel specialists converted the 2.5-litre straight-six engined machine from a trackday car to go racing post-pandemic, largely keeping it close to period specification. The 325 retains a standard five-speed gearbox and 15-inch wheels, but the Nardones have fine-tuned the handling via its Leda coilovers. Weight saving comes from perspex windows and fibreglass panels, while stopping power is provided by four-pot callipers at the front and standard E30 rear discs. Uprated pistons and the addition of throttle bodies help deliver increased power, measuring 190bhp at the wheels.</p><p>&ldquo;We could probably squeeze a bit more power out,&rdquo; said the elder brother, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s reliable and we&rsquo;ve never had any issues with it. Everything that you see apart from the cage, we&rsquo;ve done it all.&rdquo;</p><p>Having previously run the car in their own red colour scheme, the Nardones fancied a change this year while avoiding the more commonplace BMW works liveries.</p><p>&ldquo;We tried to replicate the ones that they raced in Australia,&rdquo; explained Nardone. &ldquo;It was the start of Group A and BMW didn&rsquo;t have the M3 yet, but no-one remembers them because the M3s came along [later] and destroyed everything!&rdquo;</p><p>The 325 and its predecessor 323 could be competitive in the right hands, particularly on tighter circuits. Longhurst took his to fifth in the 1986 Australian championship, claiming a podium finish at the 1.2-mile Amaroo Park.</p><p>&ldquo;Once you get them handling right, they&rsquo;re really good cars,&rdquo; said Nardone. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fun and they&rsquo;re reliable. And you can still get lots of bits for them.&rdquo;</p><h2>Best battle: MGOC bouts</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/cole-won-rcae-od-the-weekend.jpg" alt="Cole (l) and McDermind were never far apart at Pembrey" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Cole (l) and McDermind were never far apart at Pembrey</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Jones</p><p>Four-time MG Owners&rsquo; Club champion Steve McDermid faced a new challenge in the form of 2024 MG Trophy top dog James Cole &ndash; and it was Cole who put one over his engine builder, two-one across three close-fought contests.</p><p>The pair could barely be separated in the opener as McDermid shadowed track debutant Cole all the way to the flag. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Another 10 minutes of this, I can&rsquo;t do it!&rsquo;&rdquo; admitted Cole as the #1 car filled his mirrors mid-race.</p><p>Sunday morning&rsquo;s rematch was filled with incident. McDermid pounced on Cole&rsquo;s twitch exiting Honda at the end of the first lap to snatch the lead. But momentary cut-outs of his MG ZR&rsquo;s engine weren&rsquo;t helping McDermid&rsquo;s cause as Cole probed.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to try anything stupid because I like him building my engines!&rdquo; smiled Cole. However, his chance came when, just before half-distance, McDermid&rsquo;s gremlins struck approaching the tight right-hander at Brooklands. Double-declutching as he sought to regain power briefly locked McDermid&rsquo;s steering and he ran wide, letting both Cole and Robb Addison through.</p><p>In his haste to regain ground, McDermid rotated when he clipped a bump at Dibeni a little later and could only finish sixth. Instead, Addison &ndash; who raced against Cole&rsquo;s father Doug more than 25 years ago &ndash; assumed his role and harried Cole to the flag.</p><p>Two-nil, and the weekend bragging rights were now Cole&rsquo;s. But McDermid saved face as he withstood lights-to-flag pressure from Cole to win the finale.</p><h2>Star performer: Davison in Pre-&rsquo;93 Touring Cars</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/davidson-2.jpg" alt="Davison had not previously won in Pre-'93 Touring Cars but got the better of Bower in all three contests" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Davison had not previously won in Pre-'93 Touring Cars but got the better of Bower in all three contests</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Jones</p><p>Before Pembrey&rsquo;s triple-header, Will Davison had never won in Pre-&rsquo;93 Touring Cars. Now, he is a three-time victor.</p><p>Going into the weekend, Ian Bower had four wins from four races in his BMW M3 E36 &ndash; a car, ironically, that Davison tends alongside his own. Bower again had the edge in qualifying, outpacing Davison by a quarter of a second.</p><p>But, despite the double champion converting pole into the lead, Davison&rsquo;s pressure told. He dived past Bower at Brooklands on lap five of 14 before scampering to a 4.3-second victory.</p><p>The key to Davison&rsquo;s success in the sequel &ndash; despite a grassy moment &ndash; was holding off Bower&rsquo;s challenge into Hatchets hairpin.</p><p>&ldquo;Going into the first corner it was side by side, and it was do or die because he brakes the latest of anyone,&rdquo; said Davison. &ldquo;Ian&rsquo;s fearless &ndash; he&rsquo;s a really confident driver. After that it was just little by little.&rdquo;</p><p>Penalties for a messy rolling start affected Sunday&rsquo;s race but it was still Davison who topped Pre-&rsquo;93. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy because I&rsquo;ve been trying to hunt Ian down all season, getting a little bit closer, never quite there,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;So to finally get in front of him feels really nice.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/2cv-in-the-sun.jpg" alt="The Citroen 2CVs enjoyed a 90-minute enduro that was topped by Sebastian Jones-White and Luca Proietti (13)" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">The Citroen 2CVs enjoyed a 90-minute enduro that was topped by Sebastian Jones-White and Luca Proietti (13)</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Jones</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The best F1 driver in history is a debate that has, and will continue to, rage as long as Formula 1 exists, but we look at who the best drivers are statistically.</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKEnRAw0/s8/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-1st-po-1.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 1st position, celebrates on arrival in Parc Ferme" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 1st position, celebrates on arrival in Parc Ferme</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jerry Andre / <a href="https://www.motorsportimages.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorsport Images</a></p><h2>1.

Michael Schumacher - 91 wins</h2>First race: 1991 Belgian Grand PrixWorld Championships: 7 (1994-95, 2000-04)Number of races: 308Number of wins: 91Number of pole positions: 68Career points: 1566<p>When considering the best F1 driver, Michael Schumacher immediately springs to mind. He was, until the rise of Hamilton, the face of domination in Formula 1: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting competitiveness &ndash; Schumacher changed the game in F1 with his combination of dedication, passion, and, of course, raw talent.</p><p>While he took two titles with Benetton, he&rsquo;s far more well-known for his time with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferrari</a>. He joined the team in 1996 and, after some highs and lows in the following years, the combination struck gold in 2000. What followed in the next five years were five world titles, 48 wins, and a record book that had Michael Schumacher&rsquo;s name in almost every field.</p><p>His second stint in F1 wasn&rsquo;t as successful as his first, yielding a single podium to add to his collection. However, his 91 wins, 155 podiums and 68 pole positions still put him high up in any statistical analysis. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/michael-schumachers-top-10-f1-victories-5111617/5111617/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See our top 10&nbsp;Schumacher victories here</a>.</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99PxVbY/s8/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Mark Sutton / <a href="https://www.motorsportimages.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorsport Images</a></p><h2>3. Max Verstappen - 65 wins</h2>First race: 2015 Australian Grand PrixWorld championships: 4 (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)Number of races: 216Number of wins: 65Number of pole positions: 43Career points: 3147.5<p>Max Verstappen, son of former Formula 1 driver Jos, spent just one year in car racing before making his F1 debut. While he got to grips with the single-seaters in the Florida Winter Series, his junior career is best remembered for his 2014 European Formula 3 campaign when he finished third in the championship behind Tom Blomqvist and title-winner Esteban Ocon.&nbsp;</p><p>This single season, in which he took 10 wins from 32 races, including six consecutive wins, was enough to earn him the move up to F1, taking a seat at Red Bull sister team Toro Rosso for 2015 and becoming the youngest-ever grand prix driver. His inaugural F1 season returned some success in middle-of-the-pack machinery &ndash; 10 points-paying finishes from 19 races &ndash; but it was his second season where he really announced his entry in F1.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the call up to the senior Red Bull team five races into the 2016 season, replacing the beleaguered Daniil Kvyat, Verstappen took his first win immediately at the Spanish GP, aided by Mercedes team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton crashing out together on the first lap.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d take a further nine wins by the end of the 2020 season, before the tweaked technical regulations for the 2021 season resulted in Red Bull producing a car truly capable of fighting for the world title. With the Red Bull much closer to the previously dominant Mercedes car, Verstappen and Hamilton engaged in an arduous, season-long battle for the title. The fight came down to the final lap of the final race, with Verstappen just taking the honours ahead of the seven-time world champion for his first title since karting in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2022 championship was a much easier time for the Dutchman by comparison. Though he failed to finish two of the opening three rounds due to reliability trouble, Verstappen sailed to the title behind the wheel of the RB18, with his win in Suzuka proving enough to take the title. His run to the 2023 title was imperious, breaking records for wins and points with relative ease. With four titles to his name, it remains to be seen how many more he can add to his tally.</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-2.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68ynL7X0/s8/sebastian-vettel-red-bull-rb9--1.jpg" alt="Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull RB9 Renault" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull RB9 Renault</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Etherington / <a href="https://www.motorsportimages.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorsport Images</a></p><h2>4.

Over the next four years he became the face of F1, winning four consecutive championships and becoming the youngest world champion in the process (taking the accolade from Lewis Hamilton). He also secured the records for most podium finishes in a season, most wins in a season, most pole positions in a season, most laps led in a season, most consecutive wins, most consecutive grand slams, and most wins from pole position in a season.</p><p>Unfortunately for Vettel the regulation changes in 2014 didn&rsquo;t suit <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/red-bull-racing/36469/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull</a> (or him), and the team quickly fell back through the pack. He went from nine consecutive wins in the final nine races of the 2013 season to not winning a single race until 2015, and since that 2013 season he&rsquo;s &lsquo;only&rsquo; taken 14 wins. Despite that he was still widely regarded as one of the best drivers on the grid until his retirement at the end of the 2022 season, and his list of records is likely to stand for many more seasons.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/sebastian-vettels-top-f1-wins-ranked-4982104/4982104/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Sebastian Vettel's top 10&nbsp;wins here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeW3yn2/s8/podium-second-placed-elio-de-a-1.jpg" alt="Podium: Second placed Elio De Angelis, Lotus, race winner Alain Prost, McLaren, third placed Thierry Boutsen, Arrows" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Podium: Second placed Elio De Angelis, Lotus, race winner Alain Prost, McLaren, third placed Thierry Boutsen, Arrows</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sutton Images</p><h2>5.

His secret weapon was brainpower, as well as speed, and he possessed a natural precision in his driving that allowed Prost to become France's first world champion in 1985.</p><p><strong>Race of my life: <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/race-of-my-life-alain-prost-on-the-1990-mexican-gp-4982358/4982358/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prost on the 1990 Mexican GP</a></strong></p><p>In 1987 he beat <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jackie-stewart/842767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackie Stewart</a>'s record of 27 wins and a year later <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> won 15 out of 16 races across the season, which is testament to both Prost and Senna's skill.

His second title the year later was a 13-point lead over the great Michael Schumacher, though this is where Alonso&rsquo;s good fortune seemed to run out.</p><p>A move to McLaren in 2007 to partner then-rookie Lewis Hamilton saw him finish the season in third, just one point behind winner Kimi Raikkonen and behind Hamilton, who had the same points but more wins. His 2010 move to Ferrari looked like it would pay off as he entered the final race of the season in the lead, but a combination of him getting stuck behind <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/vitaly-petrov/841484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitaly Petrov</a> and a win for Sebastian Vettel meant Alonso had to settle for second. He missed the 2012 title by just three points (again to Vettel), and was second again in 2013 (though was 155 points the German).</p><p>He moved back to McLaren in 2015 &ndash; just in time for the disastrous McLaren-Honda relationship &ndash; and after four tough years he left at the end of 2018 &ndash; just before McLaren made their way back towards the front of the grid.</p><p>Even the 2021 season was unkind to Alonso &ndash; racing for the midfield <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> team he secured a fourth place at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix (the best he&rsquo;d finished for seven years) while his team mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/esteban-ocon/840488/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esteban Ocon</a> went on to win, though a long-awaited 98<sup>th</sup> podium finally came in Qatar.</p><p>A shock move to Aston Martin for the 2023 season proved to be a masterstroke, as the team rocketed up from midfield to the front of the pack. Alonso opened the season with two third places - giving him his prestigious 100th career podium in the 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.</p><p>Despite the terrible luck that Alonso has exhibited in Formula 1 he&rsquo;s still taken 32 wins, 22 pole positions and 23 fastest laps, and is a firm fan favourite. <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/fernando-alonsos-10-greatest-f1-races-5111514/5111514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can read more about his greatest races here</a>.</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qXq3Np6/s8/race-winner-nigel-mansell-will-1.jpg" alt="Race winner Nigel Mansell, Williams FW11B Honda" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Race winner Nigel Mansell, Williams FW11B Honda</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: <a href="https://www.motorsportimages.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorsport Images</a></p><h2>8.

As a triple champion and dominant force in the sport, Stewart had the credibility needed to change the culture around safety in motorsport. After seeing too many of his friends and colleagues killed doing what they loved, Stewart was a key pioneer in the introduction of full-face helmets, seatbelts, travelling medical units, safety barriers, runoff areas and more.</p><p>Outside his quest for safety, Stewart was a prodigious talent on track and was the man to beat throughout his time on the grid, claiming three world titles with Ken Tyrrell's eponymous team as the two formed an irrepressible double-act in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/the-10-greatest-races-from-britains-best-f1-driver-5110180/5110180/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Jackie Stewart's best races here</a>.</p><img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-2.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0mbWOOq2/s8/niki-lauda-ferrari-312t-1.jpg" alt="Niki Lauda, Ferrari 312T" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /><p class="title">Niki Lauda, Ferrari 312T</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: <a href="https://www.motorsportimages.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorsport Images</a></p><h2>=10.

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/robert-shwartzman/841976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Shwartzman</a> has stunned by taking pole position for this year&rsquo;s Indianapolis 500, going from the bottom of the timesheets at the start of the week to the very top in the pole shootout.</p><p>The 25-year-old is the first rookie to earn pole for IndyCar's crown jewel event in 42 years, and will share the front row with two-time Indy 500 winner <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/takuma-sato/829586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Takuma Sato</a>, plus <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/pato-oward/869723/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pato O'Ward</a> in third.</p><p>"No, honestly I can't believe it," Shwartzman told IndyCar on FOX. "I was closing my eyes like this is a dream, it can't be true. Honestly, I don't know what even to say. The car felt amazing, like honestly, I can't thank Prema and Chevy [enough]. They did such a good job. It's unbelievable.</p><p>"Coming here for my first oval race, I would never expect myself to be in this position. It's unbelievable. Big thanks to everybody."</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/scott-dixon/829217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Dixon</a> heads up the second row in fourth, in front of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/felix-rosenqvist/841454/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Rosenqvist</a> and runaway IndyCar championship leader <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-palou/841469/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Palou</a> who fill out the second row for the Indy 500.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6zQGPgpY/s1000/robert-shwartzman-prema-racing.jpg" alt="Robert Shwartzman, Prema Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Robert Shwartzman, Prema Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Brandon Badraoui / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>Sato had taken provisional pole early in the Fast 6 round with a 232.478mph, holding off the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/chip-ganassi-racing/36501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chip Ganassi Racing</a> duo of Dixon and Palou, but it was not meant to be Sato's first pole in the 500 as a shocking upset emerged from Shwartzman.</p><p>In the Fast 12 session, only nine drivers ran following drama for the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/team-penske/36470/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Penske</a> trio. It began with <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/scott-mclaughlin/829903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott McLaughlin</a>'s airborne crash in morning practice, which completely destroyed his #3 Team Penske Chevrolet car.</p><p>The drama continued as the other two Penske cars were abruptly pulled out of the Fast 12 qualifying line. As it turns out, an issue was found in pre-qualifying inspection involving the rear attenuator of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/829788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Newgarden</a>'s car. The same issue existed on <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/will-power/829451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Will Power</a>'s car and Penske attempted to fix it in the pitlane. However, these modifications were not allowed and they were denied a shot at the Indy 500 pole.</p><p>As for the drivers that were allowed to go out, the battle for the final transfer spot came down to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/david-malukas/867148/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Malukas</a> and Palou, but there was little Malukas could do as the championship leader vaulted himself into the Fast 6.</p><p>Therefore Malukas will start the Indy 500 in seventh, ahead of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/christian-lundgaard/841987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Lundgaard</a> and 2022 Indy 500 winner <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/marcus-ericsson/829603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Ericsson</a>, with McLaughlin 10th, Power 11th, and Newgarden 12th.</p><h2>Abel fails to qualify for Indy 500 in team-mate battle over last spot</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gpl1Gn0/s1000/jacob-abel-dale-coyne-racing.jpg" alt="Jacob Abel, Dale Coyne Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Jacob Abel, Dale Coyne Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/jacob-abel/950546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Abel</a> was the driver who failed to qualify for the Indy 500 in the final row of the grid decider, after losing out to Andretti Global's <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/marco-andretti/829172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Andretti</a>, Meyer Shank Racing's <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/marcus-armstrong/841974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Armstrong</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/dale-coyne-racing/36587/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dale Coyne Racing</a> team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/rinus-veekay/841482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rinus VeeKay</a>.</p><p>Armstrong was the first of the four Honda drivers to go out, reaching 229.091mph in his four-lap run. Andretti eclipsed him with a 229.741mph.</p><p>Alarm bells began to ring for Abel and DCR, as his first run only reached 227.112mph. VeeKay ran a 227.740mph, putting team-mate Abel on the hot seat.</p><p>As the time clicked away, VeeKay made the bold decision to throw away his first run and move into the fast lane. He went out on track, but actually ran slower. Panic began to set in as he now nervously held a 226.913mph run.</p><p>But on Abel's final run he was not able to do any better, only reaching 226.394mph over the course of his run, to gift Veekay entry in last place.</p><p>"Unfortunately, starting yesterday, kind of been preparing for this a little bit," Abel told IndyCar on FOX. "Super, super weird situation. We were happy all week long. The car was fast. We were very conservative with everything and we were ready to trim it out. It seems like something just happened overnight, Friday to Saturday, and we just immediately lost speed and it's just been getting slower and slower every run.</p><p>"I thought we had a chance there at the end because our team-mate went slower. It's not how you want to do it, obviously. I don't need to tell you guys how good Rinus VeeKay is around here. I think we're struggling a little bit. It sucks. I thought this was going to be my first Indy 500 but yeah, hopefully that day will come sooner rather than later."</p> ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Christian Horner has hailed <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a>&rsquo;s sensational opening-lap overtake on polesitter <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a> as the difference to set up his <a href="https://www.autosport.com/location/imola/27744/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formula 1 Imola Grand Prix victory</a>, as the Red Bull boss labelled it a &ldquo;win it or bin it&rdquo; manoeuvre.</p><p>Verstappen swooped past Piastri around Tamburello to power into the lead, where he controlled the pace, despite one safety car restart and one virtual safety car period.</p><p>It was Verstappen&rsquo;s second win of the year and means he now trails championship leader Piastri by just 22 points.</p><p>Horner spoke of his relief at the result, which follows a slow start for the team after it lost its constructors&rsquo; championship title to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> last season. He says the result was a morale-boosting victory and arrives at a crucial time as the F1 season moves to a period of predominantly European races.</p><p>He said: &ldquo;The start was pretty average. It was the first corner, and I think maybe Oscar was more focused on <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> and he left the slightest of gaps and Max just sent it and it was kind of win it or bin it. And again, he's just so good in that situation where he just sees a gap and it's so decisive for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thereafter, we just had the pace to pull out a gap. We had the margin on tyre degradation that we could see were in a better shape than the McLarens.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gpl1n70/s1000/christian-horner-red-bull-raci.jpg" alt="Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>&ldquo;Then the VSC came out. That was at an opportune time, circa mid-race. And then the safety car came out, which was another essentially free pitstop for the first couple of guys.</p><p>&ldquo;But at all times, Max had the pace. He was able to respond. It never felt that we were under pressure from behind. So, it was a great performance.

<![CDATA[ Ogier: Rally Portugal among most physically demanding of WRC career ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Sebastien Ogier declared his record-extending seventh Rally Portugal triumph among the most physically demanding rallies of his storied World Rally Championship career.</p><p>The eight-time world champion, co-driven by <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/vincent-landais/863990/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Landais</a>, held off Hyundai&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/ott-tanak/829695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ott Tanak</a> to collect a 63rd career win at the gravel event that delivered his first 15 years ago.</p><p>Ogier conceded that victory would have been unlikely had rival Tanak, who led from stage two, avoided a power steering failure on Saturday that forced the Estonian to surrender a 13.9s lead.</p><p>Fighting Tanak wasn&rsquo;t the only challenge as the part-time Toyota driver admitted he&rsquo;d rarely struggled as much physically in a rally car and was feeling on the limit due to an intense rally schedule.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/WRC-drivers-questions-crazy-long-Portugal-itinerary-after-14-hour-Friday/10723496/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The rally featured a 10-stage Friday leg comprising 683km</a>, of which 146km were competitive stages punctuated by two 20 minute remote services. It meant crews were on the road for 14 hours which was then followed by a 13-hour Saturday with crews leaving the service park at 6am. The first of Sunday&rsquo;s six stages also began at 6:43am.</p><p>&ldquo;For me, I have almost never been struggling like this physically in a rally car. Saturday was really on the limit as a consequence of a really long day and short night. I really struggled to have enough energy and especially when it is rough like this you need to fight a lot with the steering. I was really feeling on the limit,&rdquo; said Ogier on Saturday.</p><p>After clinching the win Ogier, said: &ldquo;I still feel very exhausted, maybe not as bad as it was yesterday afternoon as now I know I can relax, but the fact I can relax, it has made me realise how low on energy I am. It has been one of the most demanding rallies I have ever done physically.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0rGX17J2/s1000/winners-sebastien-ogier-vincen.jpg" alt="Winners S&eacute;bastien Ogier, Vincent Landais, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Winners S&eacute;bastien Ogier, Vincent Landais, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT Toyota GR Yaris Rally1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Toyota Racing</p><p>&ldquo;I will need some time to recover but first of all I would like to celebrate it with the team. I&rsquo;m looking forward to having a drink with them because they are all working very hard. We talk about ourselves but what the mechanics and every team member has to handle in terms of hours working is very tough also.&rdquo;</p><p>On top of a demanding schedule and hot temperatures, Ogier was locked in an intense fight with Tanak through Friday and Saturday. This continued on Sunday as the latter mounted a charge to recover from a broken steering rack.</p><p>Tanak claimed the maximum Super Sunday points, ending the rally 8.7s adrift of winner Ogier.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/wrc-portugal-sebastien-ogier-claims-record-extending-win/10724088/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/254MEbk0/s2/sebastien-ogier-vincent-landai-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">WRC Portugal: Sebastien Ogier extends record with another win</a><p>&ldquo;It was a quite nice Sunday drive [from Tanak]. I don&rsquo;t know where he wanted to go, maybe it was church or somewhere, he was in a hurry it looks like!&rdquo; Ogier smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;He was really quick all rally. It was a little bit different to what we have seen recently, as on tarmac we [Toyota] were pretty dominant as a team but this weekend was the opposite. We were missing a bit of performance compared to them [Hyundai].</p><p>&ldquo;With such a lead in the past, the Sunday drive would have been a bit less pressure but now we have guys pushing the maximum [for Super Sunday points]. Basically nowadays rallies are maximum push from start until the end, it has made the victory even tougher to secure.</p><p>&ldquo;It is even more reason to enjoy and celebrate the win, as it is more enjoyable after a fight. I think the wins nowadays need a harder fight to get them.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Seven-time world champion <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> said the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/location/imola/27744/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix</a> was the first time he felt at one with his <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferrari</a>&nbsp;Formula 1 car since his China sprint win.</p><p>Hamilton's shock pole-to-flag victory in Shanghai proved to be an outlier in what has otherwise been a difficult campaign which has not brought the results he was hoping to achieve on his fresh start in a new environment at Ferrari.</p><p>Imola also didn't appear likely to turn around his fortunes after he qualified 12th, one spot behind team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/840485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>, but on Sunday afternoon the Briton displayed strong race pace and used strategy and a touch of fortune from the safety car timings to vault up the order to fourth.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-imola-gp-max-verstappen-and-red-bull-outfox-mclaren-for-victory/10724097/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6zQGPAJY/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">F1 Imola GP: Verstappen beats both McLarens for flawless victory</a><p>Hamilton felt it was the first time since his momentous China sprint race win that he felt at one with the Ferrari car, which has received subtle upgrades this weekend.</p><p>"China was pretty great, but I've always loved when you're fighting from further back and coming through," Hamilton said.

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> climbed from fourth to second in Formula 1&rsquo;s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but admitted that the leading Red Bull of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> was simply too &ldquo;fast&rdquo; around the Imola GP circuit.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>&nbsp;had won five of the previous six races, but <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-imola-gp-max-verstappen-and-red-bull-outfox-mclaren-for-victory/10724097/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to concede defeat to the Red Bull of Verstappen</a> after the Dutchman took the lead of the race in the opening lap. Despite a late charge from Norris after the safety car, the Brit couldn&rsquo;t chase down Verstappen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think second was best we could achieve today,&rdquo; Norris told Sky TV after the race.</p><p>&ldquo;Max was fast. The Red Bull was quick, you know, so I don't think we really had an answer to them&nbsp;&ndash; even in the final stint.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6l9rV980/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Autosport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>"It was just a long race, [with] a lot of options that came and went. But I think second was the best we could do today. So, I'm happy with that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Norris continued that even if he had managed to qualify on the front row instead of fourth, &ldquo;Max was too quick for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>This mirrored the experience of his McLaren team-mate <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>, who took his third pole position of the season in Imola. However, his lead of the race didn&rsquo;t last long as Verstappen lunged around the outside of Tamburello to take first position on the opening lap.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dutchman&rsquo;s victory means just 22 points separate the top three drivers, with Verstappen in third, Norris second and Piastri leading with 146 points to his name.&nbsp;</p><p>After closing the gap to his team-mate, Norris says he is now feeling &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive&rdquo; about his performance on Sunday to recover from an underwhelming qualifying at Imola.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm very happy with my Sundays,&rdquo; Norris said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have been the whole season, and I still feel like I'm very strong.</p><p>"It's just my Saturdays make my life way too difficult come Sunday.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/lando-norris-processes-fourth-on-imola-gp-grid-after-never-good-enough-q3-/10723859/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/2wBNLWB0/s2/lando-norris-mclaren.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Norris faces fourth on Imola GP grid after "never good enough" Q3 </a><p>&ldquo;I have to fight back.
