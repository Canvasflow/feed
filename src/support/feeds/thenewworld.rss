            <description><![CDATA[If right wingers like Matt Goodwin want us to have more babies, perhaps he could think of ways to make parenthood affordable again]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>In a turn of events that has surprised absolutely no one, the Reform candidate for Gorton and Denton, Matt Goodwin, has managed to offend people.</p>

<p>Recently unearthed footage from November 2024 shows Goodwin mansplaining about where women are going wrong. “Many women in Britain are having children much too late in life,” he said, adding, “we need to also explain to young girls and women the biological reality of this crisis.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>This patronising guff has sparked a considerable backlash. Natalie Fleet, MP for Bolsover, who became pregnant at 15, compared his comments to <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>. Goodwin’s suggestion that women who have two or more children should be taxed less has also drawn comparisons to the policies of the Nazi regime, which awarded medals to women who had large numbers of children.</p>

<p>Goodwin’s comments also ignore entirely the role of men in producing children. He might, for example, consider this comment from Samantha, 32, who put it bluntly: “For people like me who aren’t desperate to have kids, we now have a choice. I would only want to have a child with a man who adds to my life and who I believe would share the responsibility. But I still don’t think that’s how it is. Among married friends, I don’t see equal weighting for some of them.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should sacrifice myself and my life and objectives unless the person I’m doing it with is going to do the same. Men say they want to be fathers but don’t understand that they need to get their shit together for us to want to have kids with them.”</p>

<p>It is, of course, not the first time right wing groups have seized on falling birth rates. The “Tradwife” movement – a hyper-romanticised vision of domesticity in which women stay at home, beatifically raising a small football team of children and baking sourdough – has developed a particular hold over MAGA-adjacent corners of the internet. Endless accounts, often AI-generated, often suspiciously bot-like, pump out images of impossibly serene, linen clad motherhood.</p>

<p>Falling birth rates are a darling topic of the alt-right, though it might depend on <em>which</em> falling birth rates. They may not be overjoyed to hear that births to non-white ethnic groups in the UK remain proportionally higher than to white British groups.</p>

<p>The subject is frequently deployed as a dog whistle by white nationalists pushing the so-called “Great Replacement” theory, that native white populations are being deliberately “replaced” through immigration.</p>

<p>Still, while birth rates may be weaponised by politicians and influencers nostalgic for the 1950s, the issue itself is real, and one that governments across the world are actively trying to address.</p>

<p>Birth rates in England and Wales have fallen to record lows, with the total fertility rate dropping to about 1.41 children per woman in 2024 – well below the 2.1 needed to maintain the population without migration, according to the ONS. </p>

<p>In France, the government recently wrote to 29-year-olds urging them to reproduce. In Japan and South Korea – both facing some of the lowest fertility rates in the world – billions have been poured into encouraging schemes, including lump-sum birth allowances of around ¥500,000 (about £2,400).</p>

<p>What Goodwin says is not entirely inaccurate: men and women in the UK are indeed having children later, and in some cases not at all. But to suggest this is because women are somehow deluded about their own fertility is not only insulting to a generation of women who are routinely reminded – at GP appointments, via targeted ads for egg freezing on the London Underground, and in uncomfortable Christmas dinner table commentary – that their biological clock is ticking. It also ignores the far more obvious socioeconomic pressures that are shaping their decisions.</p>

<p>The sharpest declines are among women in their 20s, and projections suggest many young women today will have just one child by 35, as the average age of first-time motherhood rises to around 31, and fatherhood to 35.</p>

<p>So why are millennials and Gen Zers having fewer kids, later? On the surface, it seems pretty obvious. Only around 39% of people aged 25-34 in the UK own their own home, down sharply from about 59% in 2000. People are leaving university with an average student loan debt of around £53,000. And full-time nursery care costs can average roughly £239 per week for a child under two. </p>

<p>When jobs are lacking, rent is climbing, and the cost of simply existing is so high, the neat and traditional milestones of adulthood look far less attainable than they did for previous generations.</p>

<p>Bradley, 22, is firmly in the camp of never wanting children. “I’ve given up any hopes of owning a house, as many my age have, and think that whatever disposable income I do eventually have, I would much prefer to spend on living a fulfilling life rather than creating another one.”</p>

<p>But is it only economic reality that is stifling birth rates? After all, some of the countries with the lowest fertility, such as Sweden and Japan, rank highly for quality of life and economic performance.</p>

<p>Bradley’s opposition to fatherhood is also shaped by a broader disillusionment with the state of the modern world. “Initially my opposition to having children was moral – based on the huge climate impact of putting another person into the world and the question of whether putting a kid into such an awful world is a kind thing for them.”</p>

<p>He adds another, more uncomfortable layer: “I would find it really hard to raise a son. I would struggle to reconcile my dislike for them – in their inevitable awful teenage boy phase – with my role as their father. I would genuinely reconsider my opposition to having kids if I could guarantee it was a girl.”</p>

<p>He is not alone in bringing gender anxieties into the conversation. Many people blame “ambitious”, degree-collecting, flat-renting women who have apparently been duped by liberal modernity into delaying motherhood, thereby fuelling both plummeting birth rates and the so-called male loneliness epidemic (a line of argument frequently aired by figures such as Jordan Peterson).</p>

<p>But what about men’s role in baby making? Why is no-one blaming them? Columnist Stella Tsantekidou posted on X: “Please stop lecturing women. The world is overflowing with beautiful, successful single women of reproductive age begging for a normal man to come along, and most have been looking since they were 20, frankly.</p>

<p>“Tell men to get over their alcohol and drug addictions, to commit to one woman and not waste their time, learn how to ask questions and take an interest in women as humans, basic standards of taking care of themselves, manners, get over their anger management issues etc.”</p>

<p>Some may call that “strident”, but it is a frustration shared among women in their late 20s and early 30s who feel the pressure to have children intensifying while, as Samantha suggested, the pool of suitable partners feels, to them, unappealing.</p>

<p>In the UK, young women are now significantly more likely than young men to hold a university degree, and young men are also more likely to be NEET (not in employment, education or training). They are also considerably more likely to live with their parents into their late 20s and early 30s.</p>

<p>The reasons why the birth rate is falling are numerous and complex, but I err on the side of a generation that has been routinely screwed over, and then routinely blamed for it. A cohort supposedly trapped in arrested development thanks to Covid, sky-high rents and childhood bedrooms that have lingered far longer than anyone planned. A generation accused of not drinking, not dating, not having sex, when a few drinks can wipe out half a week’s disposable income. </p>

<p>Even for those who want the old milestones, there is no guarantee that the traditional formula of job, partner, house, baby, will fall into place, and certainly not neatly within the window of our so-called “biological reality”.</p>

<p>So if politicians are genuinely alarmed about plummeting birth rates, perhaps the solution is to tackle the housing crisis: cohabiting in a studio flat where you can see the pile of dirty dishes from the marital bed isn’t exactly a recipe for romance. Fix the graduate jobs market so young adults can imagine affording both children and a life. Make going out feel possible again, so future couples can meet under the loosened inhibitions of a few vodka and cokes. </p>

<p>If politicians want more babies, maybe they could start by making life feel less impossible for the people expected to have them.</p>

<p>Randy Andy! Air Miles Andy! The now simply-monickered Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been bestowed with many sobriquets from the tabloid press down the years – but it appears his nickname among his own security detail may have been a touch more earthy.</p>

<p>Footage from a four-year-old interview from Australia’s <em>60 Minutes</em> programme with former personal protection officer Paul Page has reemerged on social media in the light of the former prince helping the police with their enquiries. In it, presenter Tara Brown presses him on what Andrew was known as.</p>

<p>“Did Prince Andrew have a nickname at that time?” she asks, smiling.</p>

<p>“His official code… so, if he was to come into the palace his call code was Purple Four-One,” says Page. “But he did have a nickname, but it’s a bit rude for me to tell you… I’ll tell you, but you’re not gonna be able to air it.</p>

<p>“He was just called… do you want me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” says Brown.</p>

<p>“He was called the c**t,” says Page. “Plain and simple.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, it being Australia, the word was aired in full.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Want to join the UK Independence Party – which, unaccountably, still exists – but are worried that, at £30 a year, membership is just a little <em>too</em> cheap?</p>

<p>The party which, under armband-clad Nick Tenconi’s leadership has become a tiny, extreme-right Christian sect with a quirky reading of the Bible, has just introduced the UK12 tier of membership – an elite level of ‘Kipper which comes with a badge and costs just £1,000… A MONTH.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The party, whose members are not thought to number much into four figures these days, says the UK12 will “help us achieve our political goals in the build up to the 2029 general election”. For their £12,000 a year members will get a quarterly dinner with Tenconi, access to a WhatsApp group with UKIP leaders, biweekly Zoom meetings, a badge of the party’s new logo (which bears a remarkable similarity to the Iron Cross, the German military decoration for bravery widely associated with the Nazi period) and various other things most normal people would gladly part with 12 grand <em>not</em> to have.</p>

<p>In his email to its dwindling number of members advertising the new tier, Tenconi actually leans into the party’s increasing extremism, writing: “With the rise of far-right extremism, racism and anti-Semitism now being legitimised by the ‘online right’ our importance and significance has increased even further.”</p>

<p>It comes as Ukip has made overtures to Rupert Lowe’s new Restore Britain party to join forces, Tenconi saying this week: “I have a number of questions for Rupert. 90% of his team know me and have my mobile number. Any one of them can call at any time to arrange a sit down with Rupert for us to discuss particulars of this incredibly exciting right wing alliance.”</p>

<p>Whether or not the pair team up depends on if Lowe’s party is prepared to cede to UKIP’s demands, with Tenconi saying “UKIP will not renegade [sic] on our position”. One of these is deporting Communists from Britain to North Korea, which might be a bit mad even for crackpot Lowe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Last September 20,000 filled London’s Millennium Done – sorry, O2 – to hear former US president Barack Obama speak about his time in office. Now another huge figure of recent political history is going on the road to pass on his wisdom – albeit to slightly more bijou venues.</p>

<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has been largely twiddling his thumbs after his little-watched reality show <em>Meet The Rees-Moggs</em> was cancelled and his GB News presenting hours were slashed in half, while his <em>Starkey &amp; Mogg</em> podcast with David Starkey, after a brief initial flurry, seems to have stalled after just three episodes.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Now, perhaps inspired by Obama’s arena-filling ability, Rees-Mogg is launching his own live show, <em>Mogg Unbuttoned</em> – “a series of live events that will take me from the green benches of Westminster to theatres across the UK” (although it should be pointed out that it wasn’t his live show which took him from the green benches of Westminster but the voters of North East Somerset who ejected him at the last general election).</p>

<p>And eschewing the big venues, he is playing some <em>very</em> slightly smaller ones. The tour starts in April at Hereford’s Courtyard Studio (capacity: 120) and Worcester’s Huntingdon Hall, where the capacity is 330 but, happily, “approximately 80 seats can be removed for dancing”. </p>

<p>Then it’s on to Shrewsbury’s Walker Theatre (capacity 250) and, ambitiously, Lincoln’s New Theatre Royal, which can seat 475. Its Victorian building will no doubt appeal to Rees-Mogg while, if he hangs around afterwards, just over a week later it plays host to foul-mouthed comedian Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown, whose on-stage attire is only slightly less ludicrous than that of Rees-Mogg.</p>

<p>Then it’s the end of the tour show at Winchester’s Theatre Royal (capacity 400), whose website promises “a political evening unlike any other: entertaining, enlightening, and just a little bit Moggical. Tickets are limited. The debate, however, is unlimited!”.</p>

<p>Quite. Don’t all rush at once!</p>

<p>“I am delighted to be Reform’s Shadow Home Secretary,” cheered Zia Yusuf on X this week – a claim so egregious that even Elon Musk’s useless context notes stirred into action, pointing out the yo-yoing former party chair is actually no such thing.</p>

<p>“The Shadow Home Secretary is an MP member of the Official Opposition (currently Conservative),” it pointed out, unhelpfully to the party Musk until recently championed. “Other parties appoint an MP as Shadow Spokesperson. Zia Yusuf is not an MP so cannot be a Shadow Spokesperson.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>And indeed, several people replied with a screenshot of a post by Lee Anderson, GB News presenter and part-time Ashefield MP, mocking a tormentor just last month with: “Thicko alert. We cannot possibly have a shadow cabinet, we have spokespersons.”</p>

<p>Still, that wasn’t even the worst thing about Yusuf’s post, which included a glossy video attacking successive governments’ records on illegal migration.</p>

<p>“More people have turned up on our beaches uninvited in the last seven years than stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day,” he fumes in the video, a favourite claim of his which, when one thinks about it, means nothing whatsoever.</p>

<p>“The Tories promised to cut immigration down to the tens of thousands in four consecutive manifestos and then allowed in 12 million people in their 14 years,” he says, to the backdrop of a rogues’ gallery of David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Hang on – hasn’t he forgotten somebody there? Or is he exempting Liz Truss – a minister for a full 10 years of that time – as rumours increasingly circulate that she is about to bring her experience and intellectual ballast to Yusuf’s party, Nigel Farage having backtracked on being unprepared to admit her?</p>

<p>But best of all, Yusuf’s attack on Labour doing nothing to stop illegal migration is illustrated by… footage of illegal migrants being removed, which Reform appears to have lifted unattributed from the Home Office’s much-derided securebordersuk TikTok account. So Yusuf’s message is: the government is doing nothing, but, er, here’s footage showing that they are.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Dominic Sandbrook’s new literary podcast struggles with forced chemistry]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Why did Dominic Sandbrook want to present a podcast about books? I suspect he wasn’t too bothered, really, but his bosses at Goalhanger decided it was time to cash in on the book club market. Who better to front <em>The Book Club</em><strong><em> </em></strong>than a man with the avuncular and occasionally witty heft of Sandbrook? </p>

<p>On the other hand, most of the people who join book clubs are women. Better have one of those too. Dominic’s got a nice rapport with his producer, Tabby Syrett – why not get her on? She’s in her late twenties, bound to appeal to the BookTok demographic.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Unfortunately, the listener hears something quite different. Syrett knows more about literature than Sandbrook, despite a thin CV. (And that inexperience should not necessarily disqualify her: his sober register needs a playful foil, and this is not a university seminar.) But her junior status makes for awkward, forced banter that echoes his views (“Mmmm! Yeah, absolutely!”) and then lurches into cringey teasing, some of it bizarrely hostile. Beatrice and Benedick it is not. </p>

<p>And how could it be? The age difference and the professional relationship forbid flirtation. What we hear is a conscientious English teacher and his lippy sixth-form student.</p>

<p>Book clubs do not sound like this. Nor do young women of Syrett’s age generally socialise with 51-year-olds except at work or family gatherings, and it shows. But enough of the lack of chemistry. What about the content?</p>

<p>Like every Goalhanger show, it is competent and well-researched. Sandbrook will do better when he is not talking about <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, a book with little to no historical context to discuss. (No, they haven’t seen the film yet. A pity, as it would have been fun to compare and contrast it with the novel.) The hosts spend a lot of time on plot exposition, which is strange: people who haven’t read the book yet won’t want it, and those who have will know it.</p>

<p>They like a bit of bathos. We hear a lot about the ill-treatment of dogs in the novel, and Emily Brontë’s dowdy dress sense. The analysis is a bit glib – there are plenty of difficult and unpleasant women in both Trollope and Dickens, contrary to what Syrett suggests – but that’s what makes this different from Radio 4, and plenty of people will appreciate it. </p>

<p>“It’s almost like this weird Platonic unity” is exactly the sort of thing people say in book clubs. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But the hosts can’t relax enough with each other to carry it off.</p>

<p>Podcasts thrive on the moment when a host goes off-script and tells us exactly what they think. (The book club equivalent is when someone gets a bit tipsy and confesses that they really, really hated this book.) Sandbrook and Syrett both agree <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is ‘unsexy’; both respect the book, but it seems to have left them cold. </p>

<p>Neither has the literary hinterland to bring something unexpected to the discussion. They only touch on the question of why a woman like Brontë, who lived a largely isolated life, wrote such a passionately deranged novel. He suggests he might be a bit like Heathcliff. She thinks otherwise. Jacob Elordi need not worry just yet. </p>

<p>It is a pity <em>The Book Club</em> lacks the Goalhanger touch, because <em>The Rest is History</em> showed how brilliantly Sandbrook can bring a subject alive when he has the right co-host and a deep knowledge of the material. It is always tempting to reuse a successful host, but <em>TBC</em> would have done better to decide whether it wanted to appeal to fiction-mad young women or an older, staider demographic. With two hosts who complemented each other, the conversation would have flowed more freely.</p>

<p>The plan is to alternate classic books (<em>1984, The Great Gatsby)</em> with readable, contemporary fiction like Kazuo Ishiguro’s <em>Never Let Me Go </em>and Philip Pullman’s <em>Northern Lights</em>. That feels right. And in an era when infinite scrolling has made opening a book more effortful, no one can complain about <em>The Book Club</em>’s mission to get people reading. </p>

<p>But it is a pity that Goalhanger – which, after years of putting out male-dominated podcasts, is belatedly hiring more female hosts – has produced a show with such an uncomfortable dynamic between its presenters. If you want some stimulating chat about fiction, Radio 4’s <em>A Good Read</em> offers more unexpected pleasures, and it’s only half an hour long.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Book Club (Goalhanger) is out now on all major podcast platforms.</strong></em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[In Good Luck. Have Fun. Don’t Die, Sam Rockwell and Gore Verbinski poke fun at the young’s tech addiction - without realising that older generations are even worse]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Everyone is concerned about teenagers. From <em>Adolescence</em> to school shooters, social media bans to mental health epidemics, I can’t read the think pieces over the sound of head-scratching. </p>

<p>Jonathan Haight’s 2024 best-seller <em>The Anxious Generation</em> is prefaced with the idea that exposing our children to screens, the internet and social media is essentially the same as conducting a massive no-holds-barred scientific experiment on their brains. We’re hammering them with the full manipulative power of a Vegas casino before they’re even out of puberty and somehow hoping that everything just works out. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>So far, so moral panic. <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> director Gore Verbinski’s new film <em>Good Luck. Have Fun. Don’t Die</em> is essentially an adaptation of <em>The Anxious Generation</em> as an extended episode of the cartoon series<em> Rick and Morty</em>. It is a sugar rush of apocalypse, on-the-nose satire and action sequences as gameplay, maddening in its lack of control and sometimes just plain mad. </p>

<p>Sam Rockwell plays a man from the future who appears in a diner one night and tells the assembled slice of America that he has come to that same diner a <em>Groundhog Day</em> number of times and will once more be recruiting a team to help him stop the coming apocalypse, which is a mixture of <em>Wall-E </em>and <em>The Matrix</em>. Oh, and if anyone has any fancy ideas,  there’s a bomb strapped to him.  </p>

<p>In between the running and jumping and endless gagging – the joke-kind, not the nausea, although the effect of one may cause the other – we get the backstories of some of the team who join up. A pair of teachers (Zazie Beetz and Michael Peña) survive a zombie attack of teenagers attached to their phones when one has the temerity to suggest they read a book. </p>

<p>A mother (Juno Temple) is offered a clone of her son after he’s killed in a school shooting. “Is this your first time?” she’s asked by a group of concerned mothers who’ve stepped out of the <em>Stepford Wives</em>. </p>

<p>And there’s a party entertainer (Haley Lu Richardson) dressed as a princess who is allergic to mobiles and wi-fi – “That’s like being allergic to air,” someone usefully remarks – has lost her true love to a virtual reality game.</p>

<p>The oddest thing is that this is a film whose appeal seems to be firmly aimed at teenagers. The satire is snark and cultural references galore; the direction is as animated as you’d expect from a director whose best film is <em>Rango,</em> and the plot dynamics ape a video game, complete with final boss. So how come a film so geared to the teenagers so despises its audience?</p>

<p>The whole film is yelling “touch grass” and as such its creators poke a judgmental finger at the mote in the eyes of the kids while ignoring the digital planks in their own eyes. The problem with social media and the internet isn’t the generations who are abutting the end of the alphabet but those that came before, the boomers and those like myself: Generation X. </p>

<p>We are the old fucks who won’t put their phones down; whose postmodernism lives in a brain that can still remember postal orders. We populate Facebook; are the only ones left on X and have email addresses with our actual names because they weren’t all used up yet. </p>

<p>We aren’t really concerned about the kids. It just gives us something to post about, to doomscroll over and in the process absolve ourselves. The kids are screwed, we tweet with a hyperlink to Johann Hari’s pile of shit book <em>Stolen Focus</em>. </p>

<p>Steven Spielberg’s<em> AI</em> is also referenced by Verbinski’s film, though it also recalls Spielberg’s weirdly ephemeral<em> Ready Player One</em>. That was a movie which managed to gross over half a billion dollars without leaving any discernible trace on the communal psyche of anyone who saw it. There was a race in it, I think. And I want to say it had scenes inside <em>The Shining’</em>s hotel?</p>

<p>Part of the problem is exactly this. Spielberg is the never-ending teenager. So when he makes a film for teenagers, he makes it about himself. His teenagers of the future geek out about <em>The Shining</em> and <em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em>. It’s solipsism with dad jeans.  </p>

<p>Which is also to say I quite enjoyed<em> Good Luck. Have Fun. Don’t Die</em>. It’s not good, I’m from being Generation X – we were the kids that separated notions of value from evaluation. We watched <em>Neighbours </em>when we were too conked out from reading Baudrillard. The film thinks it’s clever and too cool for school, without realising that anyone who says that phrase definitively isn’t. </p>

<p>So now I watch <em>Rick and Morty</em>, and obviously side with Rick, the smart, amoral time-travelling grandpa and, jokily, refer to TikTok as TokTik because dad. So we use a disdain we haven’t earned on teenagers who don’t deserve it, as we ignore the fact that the kids are vastly more savvy than we are when it comes to technology. And that they might have something to teach us, if we’d only put our phones down and listen to them.   </p>

            <description><![CDATA[Weiss made a career by playing the media outsider. But now she’s running CBS – and despite declining audience and newsroom turmoil, there’s no way she can lose]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Just over three months ago, 41-year-old Bari Weiss took on what was by far the biggest job of her career to date, becoming editor-in-chief of CBS News. She got the job as part of the acquisition of its parent company, Paramount, by Skydance, a company owned by the tech billionaire and Trump ally Larry Ellison.</p>

<p>Over that time, endless column inches have been filled with commentary on Weiss’s early performance, with particular attention going on Weiss’s controversial decision to delay the airing of a segment on CBS’s flagship show 60 Minutes. The subject of the film was the treatment of people within the CECOT detention facility, the mega-jail in El Salvador to which the Trump administration had unlawfully deported people. The decision to pull the segment, after it had been trailed and advertised, received blanket coverage and condemnation.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>More recently, the presenter Anderson Cooper stepped down from his role at 60 Minutes, after nearly two decades in the role. It was yet another substantial change at CBS, again attributed to Weiss.</p>

<p>The overall impression is that Weiss, newly installed in a role overseeing a global newsroom of 1,200 employees, is hopelessly out of her depth. Weiss, it notes, has spent her career working on the opinion pages, not news. She has barely been a news reporter, let alone an editor, and now she is overseeing a large and complex news operation. </p>

<p>She is a polarising figure, having founded <em>The Free Press</em>, a robustly right-wing news and comment outlet, in response to a perceived left-wing backlash against free expression. Everyone in US media has an opinion on Weiss, and her performance, and most of them either want or expect her to fail. </p>

<p>Some of that is doubtless due to her politics, or to the controversies she has courted. Some of it is surely due to her accumulated net worth, estimated at $100 million or more – almost all of it earned, not inherited. So, how did such a figure come to the helm of such a storied, if staid, newsroom? And what is the industry missing about her meteoric rise?</p>

<p>Unlike many who get to the top of American journalism, Weiss did not grow up in its gilded circle. Her parents were affluent but not among the yacht classes of the super-rich. They owned a flooring company in Pittsburgh, rather than a media conglomerate in New York. </p>

<p>That background was enough, though, to get Weiss a place at Columbia University – one of the most famous gateways into American journalism – where she quickly entangled herself in campus culture wars. Weiss, who is Jewish, co-founded Columbians for Academic Freedom, alleging a pro-Palestine professor had intimidated her during lectures. This activism, combined with her generally politically conservative views, made her stand out against the generally politically liberal backdrop of the school.</p>

<p>This in turn led to Weiss having an early journalistic career in conservative media, including a two-year stint at <em>Tablet</em>, a conservative Jewish publication (not to be confused with the British catholic publication <em>The Tablet</em>). Weiss was news and politics editor, her only newsroom position. This was followed by six years at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> as a junior editor and occasional contributor on the opinion and book review pages.</p>

<p>Even in her early career, one of Weiss’s standout talents was in making powerful friends. Associates, both friendly and otherwise, speak of her “flamethrower charm” in face-to-face reactions, and her phenomenal ability to network. While at the <em>WSJ</em>, Weiss established a friendship with conservative commentator Brett Stephens, one that was to pay off for her career-wise.</p>

<p>In 2016, <em>The New York Times</em> persuaded James Bennett, then the editor-in-chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> to take over the opinion section of the newspaper, where he was also widely seen as a contender to be the newspaper’s next executive editor. </p>

<p>One of Bennett’s early goals for the opinion section was to include a wider array of opinions, particularly conservative ones, leading him to poach Stephens from the <em>WSJ</em>. A few months after his arrival, Stephens convinced the <em>NYT</em> to hire Weiss, too, as an editor able to help the paper reach and publish conservative voices.</p>

<p>Weiss was now part of a conservative minority within America’s most august liberal media institution, a role fraught with a degree of discomfort. Her stint at the <em>NYT</em> coincided with constantly rising temperatures in the culture war. </p>

<p>First, liberals and conservatives disagreed on the response to #MeToo – with one side seeing a long overdue reckoning with abuses of institutional male power, and the other seeing a retrospective witch hunt against once permissible behaviour. </p>

<p>These arguments were merely a warmup for a bigger cultural clash in the form of Black Lives Matter, a surge of anger after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, leading to protests and even riots. Many acknowledged a long-overdue need for a racial reckoning, but it was accompanied by overblown and alienating language and rhetoric around race which made an easy target for conservative jeers. </p>

<p>The atmosphere in the <em>NYT</em> newsroom became febrile, and came to a head when the opinion section ran a column by senator Tom Cotton calling for the military to be called in to suppress riots. Reporters led a public backlash to the piece on social media, arguing that it harmed the safety of black reporters at the paper. In doing so, they bypassed social media rules barring news staff from criticism of the<em> NYT</em>’s editorial content.</p>

<p>The column led to tense internal meetings at the newspaper and it eventually cost Bennett his job. But Weiss, who was not directly involved in the publication of the Cotton article, managed to make herself a central figure, too, by live-tweeting an internal meeting onto the site then known as Twitter. </p>

<p>Other <em>NYT</em> staff complained she had mischaracterised her colleagues’ criticisms, and abused her privileges as an opinion staffer to post her version of events, knowing that news reporters and editors would not be allowed to challenge it publicly. </p>

<p>Weiss put herself at the centre of a live political debate as to whether the <em>New York Times</em> had become woke and censorious, framing it in a way that made her a darling of Republicans and which gave her whistleblower status. </p>

<p>But if she was looking to be martyred for her conduct, the <em>NYT</em> denied her the opportunity. She was not disciplined or asked to resign. Bennett’s successor on the opinion pages asked her to stay. Instead, she resigned, publicly lambasting the newspaper in an open letter to its publisher. </p>

<p>“My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views,” she wrote, before doing a round of every TV show going. Weiss was already deftly turning her own voluntary resignation into a cancellation, and turning herself into a star in the process.</p>

<p>For all Weiss complained about the hostile reception she had received at the <em>NYT</em>, she could hardly say joining had been a bad decision. It had given her a platform as a prominent and – relatively – young conservative voice. While she said she’d disagreed with staff, she met her wife, society journalist Nellie Bowles, and her future deputy editor, Adam Rubenstein, there. And her exit set her off into the stratosphere. </p>

<p>The most effective conservative backlash to #MeToo, Black Lives Matter and to what was for a time a functional effort to tackle online misinformation and disinformation was a pro-freedom framing, presenting conservatives as the victims of a liberal war against free speech. </p>

<p>Weiss’s exit from the <em>NYT</em> set her up as an avatar for that conflict, someone with insider status who could claim to be able to report firsthand on how the enemy thinks and operates. Weiss set up a personal Substack and helped co-found a free speech education institution, the University of Austin – where a bust of her likeness now graces the library.</p>

<p>That personal Substack was soon rechristened as <em>The Free Press</em>, growing into a staff of a few dozen, almost all personally selected and hired by Weiss. The team was fiercely loyal to and supportive of Weiss, who is spoken of as a good boss and a formidable leader. Weiss managed to secure investors into the enterprise, and more than 170,000 paying subscribers – a truly monumental achievement for a startup publication.</p>

<p>Its editorial output was contentious, particularly once Donald Trump returned to the White House and engaged in systematic assaults on the First Amendment. Trump attacked free speech on campus – particularly for pro-Palestine campaigners – and for anyone in the US on a visa. People were fired from federal agencies for their private opinions. The US is introducing social media checks for visitors. </p>

<p><em>The Free Press</em> has written little on any of these things, instead choosing to focus on the increasingly marginal excesses of the left, or else talking down the kinds of scandals and outrages it would have hyped had conservatives been in the crosshairs. The quality of the publication, as well as its values, have been criticised. </p>

<p>In 2024, it ran a report suggesting that George Floyd had died of a drug overdose, rather than police action. Despite repeated attempts to push for basic corrections, Weiss instead offered one of the article’s critics a guest spot on a podcast to discuss the issue. The appearance never happened. The incident is apparently discussed, in hushed voices, within CBS as a major question mark over the journalistic integrity of their new boss.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether <em>The Free Press</em> could have turned its meteoric early success into a lasting business. The news agenda soon moved on, and the idea of a liberal witch hunt against conservative speech became increasingly detached from reality. However, the issue soon became moot. </p>

<p>During its bidding war for Paramount, Skydance became convinced that placing Bari Weiss at the helm of CBS – which had been a constant target of Donald Trump’s ire – would help secure regulatory approval for the deal. Acquiring <em>The Free Press</em> became the way to get this done. Its $150 million sale price is huge in terms of an exit deal for a journalism startup, but close to a rounding error in the context of the $8 billion Paramount deal. <em>The Free Press</em> was bought to get Bari Weiss, and Weiss was bought to help seal the deal.</p>

<p>Weiss’s tenure as the CBS News boss, then, is not so much the fulfilment of some lifelong ambition for her, then, as a requirement of a $150 million deal that has already made her a multi-millionaire. The contractual terms of the sale require her to run this newsroom. She’s not there for fun.</p>

<p>That Weiss was installed as the boss as part of political manoeuvring by the new billionaire owners cannot have escaped anyone involved. Weiss’s success or otherwise in the role may not be measured by conventional metrics – stories broken, awards won, audience growth, or even revenue. What is wanted of her might be as simple as making sure the news division stops upsetting Trump. We simply do not know.</p>

<p>There is also a brutal truth that CBS News was increasingly irrelevant to most of America. It is a celebrated brand name in network news, especially for 60 Minutes, the programme that Anderson Cooper used for present – but its viewership was shrinking, and those remaining viewers are increasingly elderly. CBS has likely been discussed more in the three months since Weiss took over than in the three years previously.</p>

<p>For its owners, Weiss was something of a no-lose bet. She has taken over an operation in decline, with a brief to try something new. If it continues as before, she is still a multi-millionaire, now with strong new boardroom-level relationships to leverage for whatever she does next. If it fails spectacularly, then she can blame it on a backlash from establishment liberal journalists. And if by any metric it’s a success, it’s another triumph to add to that of her startup.</p>

<p>In many ways, Bari Weiss’s critics are right. She is not qualified, by any traditional metric, for the job she holds. She has never reported nor edited a truly major scoop. She doesn’t seem to care much for CBS’s traditional values.</p>

<p>But to judge her against those benchmarks is to miss entirely the game Weiss is playing. She is simply not interested in those old-world goals, or in the respect of her mostly liberal journalistic peers. Weiss is playing a different game entirely – and it’s one she’s already won.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The US is pulling back from Europe. If it withdraws its nuclear umbrella, that will leave the continent dangerously exposed. It is time to plan for that scenario]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Greenland has badly shaken Europeans’ faith in the credibility of the American nuclear umbrella. In recent weeks the leaders of Germany, Norway, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands have all called for talks on some form of “European nuclear deterrent”.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron has encouraged debate by saying that France is “open to the discussion” of a European nuclear deterrent if Europe wants greater autonomy.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>There cannot, however, be a “European bomb” as such. Neither can any European country which does not already have nuclear weapons obtain them or build them. They are all constrained by their signatures on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which prohibits them from building or acquiring nuclear weapons. And it is generally agreed that if any European country built itself a nuclear bomb then it would destroy the NPT treaty and open the floodgates to worldwide nuclear proliferation.</p>

<p>The only option is to use the existing French or British nuclear deterrents – preferably both – as a foundation of a nuclear deterrent that in a worst case scenario can replace the American umbrella.</p>

<p>But there is a problem. The British and French deterrents are built on very different foundations. In Britain’s favour, its nuclear forces are already fully committed to Nato. London also participates in Nato’s Nuclear Planning Group (NPG); the forum through which Nato allies consult on nuclear strategy. But, Britain’s Trident missiles come from the United States. This means that its deterrent is deeply embedded in the transatlantic relationship.</p>

<p>France, by contrast, insists on absolute national control. It refuses to participate in the NPG. Its nuclear forces are not under Nato command, and France refuses to discuss nuclear doctrine with allies. President Macron’s recent statements about a “European dimension” are a step in the right direction, but they do not alter the underlying reality: France’s deterrent is French, and France alone decides how it is used.</p>

<p>This leaves Europe in an uncomfortable position. If the United States were to withdraw its nuclear umbrella, suddenly Europe would be without a ready‑made alternative. Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states would lose the visible, forward‑based American nuclear forces that currently serve as a tripwire. Nato’s nuclear sharing arrangements would collapse overnight. And Europe would find itself scrambling to build a new deterrent architecture in the middle of a crisis.</p>

<p>Quiet, structured discussions must begin now, before any crisis forces Europe into improvisation. These discussions do not need to break the NPT or undermine America’s commitment to Nato. But they must prepare a diplomatic insurance policy for a scenario that European leaders increasingly fear.</p>

<p>To be credible, that insurance policy would need to build around the British and French deterrents and require three essential steps.</p>

<p>To start with, Europe would need to replace – or complement – the American “tripwire” with forward‑based British and French nuclear forces. This does not mean transferring warheads to non‑nuclear states. That is forbidden by the NPT.  It means stationing British and French tactical or intermediate‑range nuclear systems on the territory of vulnerable allies, under British and French control. Without such visible deployments, Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states would not feel secure.</p>

<p>The single biggest obstacle to a European deterrent is the French absence from the Nato Nuclear Planning group. It must join or, at the very least, establish a parallel European planning group. The NPG does not give allies control over British or American nuclear weapons; it provides consultation, transparency, and reassurance. The nuclear weapons states retain sovereign launch authority. Allies are satisfied because they have a voice in nuclear strategy. If Paris wants its “European dimension” to be taken seriously, it must be willing to discuss nuclear doctrine with its neighbours.</p>

<p>Finally, Britain and France would need to cooperate on the development of next‑generation nuclear submarines. Both countries face rising costs and shrinking industrial bases. Joint development of submarine hulls, propulsion systems, and non‑nuclear components would reduce costs, increase resilience, and symbolise a unified European nuclear pillar. This cooperation would not require shared warheads or missiles – only shared technology and shared investment.</p>

<p>None of these steps is politically easy. France guards its independence; Britain is tied into US missile systems; Germany is wary of nuclear politics; eastern Europe trusts Washington more than it does Paris. But if the American umbrella were suddenly withdrawn, these steps would become not only possible but unavoidable. </p>

<p>Europe would have days or weeks – not years – to respond. The political groundwork needs to be laid now, quietly and responsibly, so that Europe can act quickly if the worst happens.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Wellcome Sanger – half academic research institute, half industrial laboratory – is perfectly positioned to produce socially useful applications for discoveries]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>During the Covid pandemic, Boris Johnson’s promise of a “world-beating” test-and trace system came to seem like a sick joke. But there was one respect in which the UK’s testing really did excel: analysing the viral genome in samples so that the emergence of new variants could be spotted quickly. This ability relied heavily on one laboratory: the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire. Over the course of the pandemic, the institute analysed more than 2m viral genomes in a round-the-clock operation. “We were watching the pandemic evolve in real time, hour by hour, as samples came in,” says the Sanger’s director of strategy, partnerships and innovation, Julia Wilson.</p>

<p>This remarkable feat was a dramatic vindication of the Sanger’s existence and its unique status, in between an academic research institute and an industrial lab. The keystone of the Wellcome Genome Campus near the village of Hinxton, in the countryside nine miles south of Cambridge, the institute is a cluster of modernist glass and concrete springing from the meadows around the River Cam.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The Sanger was founded in 1992, with funding primarily from the Wellcome Trust, to develop the large-scale gene sequencing technology needed for the Human Genome Project (HGP), the international initiative to read the 3bn-letter code (“sequence”) of human DNA. The institute is named after the British biochemist Fred Sanger, who won two Nobel prizes, the second in 1980 for developing key techniques used in genome sequencing. One third of the HGP sequencing was done at the Sanger.</p>

<p>It was always clear that the HGP would initiate a demand for more sequencing. The key to understanding our genome is to tease out the small <em>differences</em> in sequence between individuals so that we can see how different gene variants are associated with specific traits and diseases. That demands not just one reference genome sequence, but many thousands or even millions. No academic labs could generate data on that scale.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, the Sanger was central to the international 1000 Genomes project that ran between 2008 and 2015 to collect and compare the genomes of “1000” (in the end it was just over 2,500) individuals, to identify common genetic variants in diverse human populations – “common” meaning that they are found in at least 1% of those populations. Impressive in its day, that effort pales in comparison with what is now possible: the Sanger has sequenced more than half of the half a million genomes stored in the UK Biobank repository, a collection of genomic material from volunteers. Data like this makes it possible to identify the genetic roots of many rare diseases associated with gene variants that only a tiny proportion of people carry, as well as showing how such variants are distributed across different populations. </p>

<p>It’s not just about data. Understanding the roles of genes in our constitution requires a huge amount of fundamental research. Using gene-editing methods to alter the genomes of individual cells, for example, can help to reveal how genes actually function and how they are linked to “phenotypes”: the characteristics of tissues and organisms. Such work is being done in university labs all over the world, but what the Sanger can offer is resources to pursue it on a larger scale. As well as having genome-sequencing facilities, the institute now possesses large-scale cell-culturing and gene-editing capabilities.</p>

<p>Thanks to such facilities, the Sanger plays a key role in the international Human Cell Atlas initiative, which seeks to map out all the cells in the human body and how they are arranged – a map that of course differs in detail for everyone, but shares the same broad structure. So far, the heart, lung, and placenta are among the tissues and organs that have been closely mapped, helping to understand the differences between healthy and diseased tissues at the cellular scale. Researchers at the Sanger also investigate the genomes of non-human organisms, from gorillas and dogs to antibiotic-resistant bacteria: information that can advance our understanding of evolution, biodiversity, and biomedicine. Cancers – how they develop, and how they can be combated – are a major focus of the research at the institute.</p>

<p>Wilson says that freedom from the academic treadmill means that the Sanger groups can take a much longer-term view, pursuing “decadal challenges that you can’t do in a university setting”. In this way, the institute has a “mandate to do science that no one else can do.”</p>

<p>“The HGP was the exemplar of a large-scale project that was hard to do in academia,” says the Sanger’s director Matthew Hurles, whose research team seeks to apply new genetic technologies to the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. Research in university departments tends to be driven by hypothesis testing, the end product of which are academic papers. Thus “academia excels at doing deep but narrow research,” says Hurles. The Sanger, on the other hand, can focus on generating large data sets, like those now needed for AI, that drive the whole knowledge ecosystem forward.</p>

<p>That’s possible because of the type of funding it receives. Academics must rely on grants, and can only conduct the projects that get funded. But the Sanger can be more strategic, because it has “core funding” guaranteed by Wellcome. Faculty leaders can decide on a programme and allocate resources in a top-down approach. “The director has the autonomy to look at what the world is doing and define strategic areas,” says Wilson. </p>

<p>This structure also means that the Sanger can pivot very quickly from one topic to another. “Wellcome wanted agility, political and financial independence,” says Wilson. That’s what made it easy for the institute to drop everything in the pandemic and devote its huge sequencing capability to analysing viral genomes.</p>

<p>Sanger researchers must, however, be on board with the mission, says Hurles – which won’t suit everyone. It doesn’t mean they get less autonomy than academics, he adds, but it’s a different kind of autonomy. “At the Sanger they get to do science that they can’t do elsewhere.” The institute currently has around 1,300 staff, which includes 30-35 faculty and principal investigators, between 80-100 PhD students and around 100 postdoctoral students. Group leader Emma Davenport says that one of the advantages compared with academia is the ability to hire new team members quickly and get working on a promising new idea right away, without having to go through the slow and painful process of applying for grants.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is no tenure for staff, and in the past the Sanger has suffered accusations of a lack of due process for hiring and firing, with some staff complaining that resources were allocated unfairly and feeling that “the axe can fall at any time”. There were also accusations of bullying and harassment, leading to an independent investigation in 2018 that cleared the institute of wrongdoing but called for more transparency in decision-making. </p>

<p>It’s perplexing that the Sanger’s model is not adopted more widely. Universities are an invaluable source of ideas and discoveries, but some objectives, especially in the life sciences, demand repetitive work that doesn’t attract academic kudos. The commercial sector can be good at turning basic science into useful applications, but in a narrow and market-driven way that doesn’t necessarily serve key societal needs. The Sanger aims to translate discovery into genuinely useful procedures before “passing the baton on to pharmaceutical and biotech companies,” says Wilson. “We deliberately democratise discovery, then move on.”</p>

<p>There are efforts internationally to fill this same gap: leveraging basic science to produce socially useful capabilities and applications and generating knowledge that is valuable rather than glamorous. Germany positions its Fraunhöfer Institutes, funded by government and industry, somewhat in that space. The United States, with a long tradition of philanthropic funding for non-profit research, has centres such as the Salk Institute in California, the Janelia Research Campus in Virginia, and the Broad Institute, affiliated with Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And since 2016 the Francis Crick Institute in London has served as a hub of biomedical research funded by the UK’s Medical Research Council and the charities Cancer Research UK and Wellcome, although Hurles says it operates rather closer to an academic model. </p>

<p>Among its projects, the Sanger Institute has worked closely with Genomics England, affiliated with the NHS to work on genomic diagnostics of disease. “One hundred and forty-five families have received rare-disease diagnosis due to a new method developed at the Sanger,” says Wilson. Davenport has been collaborating with the Rosie Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, to predict pregnancy outcomes and complications from genetic analysis. </p>

<p>It is hard to get this kind of institute right. Hurles notes that comparable institutions in the US, such as the Allen Institutes for Brain and Cell Science in Seattle, tend to be younger than 30 years or so. After a time, he says, it seems very hard to resist the “gravitational pull” of the academic system, with its rigid departments, publications-driven incentives, and dependency on grants. The UK hasn’t traditionally been very good at setting up research institutes that deviate from the standard academic model. The Alan Turing Institute, established in 2014 as a hub for research on AI, became an awkward halfway house, lacking any centralised base and staffed by fellows from academia. The result was institutional bickering over funds and a tendency for staff to do their own thing rather than collaborate; the institute is now in crisis.</p>

<p>The lack of institutional diversity in the UK was highlighted by the 2023 report on research, development and innovation headed by Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Crick Institute. “In academia, the sizes of teams, budgets, and projects are similar,” says Hurles. But there are surely many ways to produce useful knowledge. “I’d love to see more unconventional institutions like Sanger in the world,” he says. It’s not a bad idea.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Grovelling sympathy for the royals' trials and tribulations is not what is required at this moment in time]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Every royal correspondent I’ve ever met has an innate sense of deference to “The Firm”. It’s natural, I suppose. After all, they are, in the main, reporting for fans of the monarchy. But as an exercise in journalism (if you accept journalism’s job is meant to hold power to account for its abuses, not explain them away) it has always been an unhealthy relationship.</p>

<p>Jonathan Dimbleby, however, occupies a category of his own. A longtime friend, regular dinner guest and authorised biographer of King Charles, he has been rather busy of late; wheeled out wherever a pro-royal voice is required to give a King-friendly perspective on what is becoming an existential crisis.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The latest appearance was on Thursday’s BBC Radio 4’s <em>World at One</em>, and then repeated at length at the very top of Evan Davis’s <em>PM </em>show that same evening. This is what he actually said:</p>

<p>“It’s a personal crisis for them… it’s grievous for them to have to endure the institution being put under such incredible scrutiny. When we look at it more coolly and in perspective, we will see that the institution has emerged from this not weaker, but arguably – seems perverse to say it – stronger. Because it’s working.”</p>

<p>Yes. It does seem perverse to say it. Because in no objective universe does the royal family look stronger thanks to the arrest of the eighth in line to the throne. And in no objective universe could it be said that the monarchy is “working” in this instance, if by “working” he means effectively dealing with this crisis.</p>

<p>The monarchy today looks exactly what it has long feared being seen as: a closed system that protects its own until that protection threatens the institution itself.</p>

<p>The Firm hasn’t processed any wrongdoing. The stripping of titles was more about brand reputation than punishment. The King had no idea that his brother, who has always declared his innocence and who today has the same right to a presumption of that innocence as any other citizen, was being arrested this morning.</p>

<p>When Mounbatten-Windsor was arrested, it was at the new grace-and-favour home the King arranged for him on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. We can assume he remains financially supported by the King. </p>

<p>It was the late Queen’s £12million that paid off his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, of course, is not alive to see this day, having killed herself last year.</p>

<p>The King’s statement, delivered four hours after the arrest today, that the law must take its course is not a royal directive. It is not a display of virtue. It is a statement of the obvious — recognition of something that has already happened and is entirely out of his hands, crown or no crown.</p>

<p>To this country’s credit, the one process that is working, albeit belatedly, is our judicial system. Mountbatten-Windsor will now be processed through it the same as anyone else, with the same presumption of innocence our system affords anyone until they are proven guilty.</p>

<p>That this should be reported as the monarchy working is to misattribute credit. The monarchy is the institution that long enabled Prince Andrew; it protected him, comforted him and paid his bills right up until this morning. It will continue paying his bills.</p>

<p>Thursday was an historic day of reckoning for a man now arrested for a serious crime of misconduct in public office, and commonly accused of complicity in heinous sex trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>For Jonathan Dimbleby, a member of the most famous dynasty in British broadcasting, to play the role of simpering court-explainer is an embarrassment to journalism. </p>

<p>He may think he’s being loyal. He may even think it’s the truth. </p>

<p>But to those who seek it, his perverse views, so prominently broadcast by the BBC, give absolute affirmation that the commentariat is part of the same closed loop as the institutions it covers. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[GB News’s Brexiteer host has complained about the very system he voted for]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The “world’s smallest violin” playing to mock excessive self-pity has cropped up in <em>M*A*S*H*</em> (1978), <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> (1992) and even <em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em> (2002), but dates back at least to 1950s Africa. Rod Cameron, a missionary who travelled to the Zambesi Valley with his family and his ventriloquist dummy Gabby, wrote about local customs in his memoir <em>A Dummy Goes To Africa</em>: “When you’d get feeling sorry for yourself, somebody would stick out his thumb and draw his index finger across it. That’s the world’s smallest violin playing the world’s saddest song.”</p>

<p>Now another dummy has travelled a long distance and heard the strains of the planet’s tiniest Stradivarius sounding just for him. It was Andrew Pierce, the <em>Daily Mail</em> columnist and GB News host formerly known as “Tory Boy” on <em>Good Morning Britain</em>’s political slot. “1 hour &amp; 50 minutes from arriving Madrid Airport to getting into seat on @Iberia plane. Appalling service”, he tweeted on February 15.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Madrid is a sprawling airport and given that general advice is to arrive at check-in two hours before departure, it didn’t seem that Pierce had much to complain about. But the troublesome passage of this keen advocate for Brexit will hardly have been eased by having to go through non-EU passport control, which now involves the European Union’s new Entry/Exit System (EES).</p>

<p>Since Pierce was a keen Brexiteer and had posted in January 2018: “When we leave EU next year free movement of people should end at the same time”, the responses were not kind. The best was <a href="https://x.com/Septimus01/status/2023324051041915288?s=20&amp;utm_source=The+New+European+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=e0f8dcde3f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_06_05_02_14_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-8a0ec4824c-&amp;mc_cid=e0f8dcde3f&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a poem that read</a>: “Roses are red, Your passport is blue, Now stand over there, In that very long queue”.</p>

<p>For those yet to enjoy it, the EES is similar to how you are now greeted on arrival in the US. On your first trip, your fingerprints and a photo of your face are registered at a normal immigration kiosk. Subsequent trips for the next three years are supposed to require only a quick check, and the ambition is that major airports will have the kind of machines seen at some major US airports, where a quick scan of prints and face allows you to skip the line and the grim-faced, glacial-paced immigration officer waiting at the end of it.</p>

<p>Except not much of the above seems to be happening yet. Having had my picture taken and dabs done on a business trip to France last November, when I travelled to Berlin in January, I was pleased to see a row of gleaming booths that invited those already registered to line up for speedy access.</p>

<p>My travelling companion, also pre-registered, ignored this completely and went into the queue for the traditional immigration kiosks. Which is also where I ended up a few minutes later, having completed a booth scan which served no purpose whatsoever. Twenty minutes later, guess what? The officer was taking my photo and scanning my prints once again, and I was free to go. My friend, who had ignored the booths and got through much quicker, was waiting for me.</p>

<p>But look – having to stand in shame for an extra 30 minutes at the start or end of your holiday isn’t going to ruin your trip. It’s hardly the worst thing in the world. It’s not even in the top 10 worst things about Brexit.</p>

<p>And unlike Andrew Pierce, I’m not moaning about it. No need for tiny violins.</p>

<p>But there’s a difference – I didn’t vote for waiting longer in airport queues. And he did.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The powerful sociopaths who gathered around Epstein, who attended his parties and wrote him crawling emails asking for favours, need to be held accountable. The UK is starting out on that process. America – now it’s your turn]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested and charged with misconduct in public office. On his birthday. His homes in Norfolk and Windsor are being searched by police.</p>

<p>His arrest relates to emails that cropped up in the Epstein files. Andrew knew Epstein and was a regular correspondent. Andrew was also photographed alongside Ghislaine Maxwell and also Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s sex trafficking victims. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>In 2022, Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Guiffre that involved him paying her an undisclosed sum. It is notable that in 2022 Andrew also sold his chalet in Verbier, for which he got £19 million. Andrew has denied all wrongdoing and so far has not been charged with any crime.</p>

<p>It is a difficult, rather grim time to be alive. The economy is stagnant, the war in Ukraine grinds on, society is becoming more unequal and more politically polarised – and the weather is just bloody terrible.</p>

<p>But there is one tiny glimmer of light – a diamond in the ash: at least, here in the UK, there is some accountability. It doesn’t matter whether you are a senior royal, or whether you are Peter Mandelson, in Britain, if you transgress, or even if you are suspected of legal transgression, you are still going to get hauled over the coals. Thank god.</p>

<p>It is going to be interesting to watch how Andrew’s arrest is handled by the US media, where the Epstein scandal, and everything connected with it, now sits at the very heart of the Trumpist political cyclone. </p>

<p>The Trump-supporting media has done everything it can to play down the fact that Trump knew Epstein, was close to him for years, partied with him and is mentioned in the Epstein files more times than Harry Potter in the Harry Potter series.</p>

<p>Trump has also done everything he can to assure the US electorate that there is nothing to see here, recently <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/2023566470794686515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2023566470794686515%7Ctwgr%5E218b7ec44b30156f89686f2649a4363c9e0c5ee8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indy100.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump%2Ftrump-epstein-files-exonerated-claimhttps://x.com/Acyn/status/2023566470794686515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2023566470794686515%7Ctwgr%5E218b7ec44b30156f89686f2649a4363c9e0c5ee8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indy100.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump%2Ftrump-epstein-files-exonerated-claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling reporters</a>: “I have nothing to hide. I have been exonerated. I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. I have been totally exonerated on Epstein.”</p>

<p>Which is not true.</p>

<p>Today’s arrest will be profoundly unsettling for Trump. The Epstein scandal will be back in global headlines, which is precisely where he doesn’t want it, as it will lend weight to Trump’s critics, among them Marjorie Taylor Greene (read our profile of her political transformation <a href="https://www.thenewworld.co.uk/emma-kate-symons-marjorie-taylor-greene-magas-no-1-heretic/https://www.thenewworld.co.uk/emma-kate-symons-marjorie-taylor-greene-magas-no-1-heretic/">here</a>) who are stirring up trouble within the president’s own support base. </p>

<p>The focus of that discontent within MAGA is the Epstein scandal, which Greene and others are convinced is essentially a massive cover-up overseen by Trump.</p>

<p>And if the full significance of Andrew’s arrest somehow manages to pierce Trump’s fading mind, then he may find himself confronting an even darker realisation ­– that if the king of England’s brother can be arrested, then you can arrest anyone. Perhaps even a former president.</p>

<p>There is still accountability for powerful individuals here in Britain. But – at present – there is no comparable process of accountability at work in the US. Sure – Trump, and all the other powerful, rich sociopaths who gathered around Epstein, who attended his foul parties and sent him crawling emails asking for favours, have suffered a hit to their reputations. As has been pointed out in these pages, a rich man’s reputation is the only thing he cannot control.</p>

<p>But that’s not enough. Epstein committed horrific crimes. He had accomplices. They need to be held accountable. As the king himself said, on learning of his brother’s arrest: “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”</p>

<p>America, look over here – this is what accountability looks like.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[For a while it looked as if Elon Musk would dominate the world of electric cars – but then he turned out to be a basket-case. Now there’s a new global leader in town]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Few things in the world can compete with the Detroit Auto Show for sheer, in-your-face, Americana. Before even entering the show proper, visitors getting out of the freezing -12ºC weather outside (-20ºC with wind chill) are greeted by the iconic 1976 Ford Gran Torino, as used by Starsky &amp; Hutch. </p>

<p>Next to it, and right by the entrance, a Drug Enforcement Agency recruitment stand features a car fully wrapped in the American flag, and a slogan promising a “FENTANYL FREE AMERICA”. Inside, a recruitment stall for the army features a fairground game to test your punching strength, while the marines – “Earned. Never given” – allows attendees to “earn” swag including water bottles, protein shakes, and t-shirts, by doing pull-ups on a metal bar.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>There is also, of course, a dizzying array of new cars, and attentive salespeople offering to walk the thousands of attendees through the amazing benefits of each vehicle. Ford, the company who established the global car industry in a factory just ten miles from the auto show, has pride of place on the centre of the floor. </p>

<p>It is flanked on one side by General Motors – owner of Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac – and on the other by Stellantis, an international conglomerate formed in the last decade from the merger of Fiat-Chrysler and Renault, which produces everything from the Fiat 500 to the Jeep Grand Cherokee.</p>

<p>The Detroit Auto Show has heritage on its side: the global auto industry was born in this city, after all. Everything about the show projects strength, to the point that it almost seems to be trying too hard. Banners everywhere proclaim that “THERE IS ONLY ONE MOTOR CITY” – but everyone attending must know that’s not true. Detroit isn’t what it used to be. Even Ford only produces one of its vehicles – the F-150 pickup truck – from factories in the town.</p>

<p>The era of Detroit being the only show in town when it comes to cars ended long ago. But American dominance of the auto industry is – to be kind – under threat, too. This was most obvious in who wasn’t even in Detroit. Tesla, which has dominated the electric car industry for the last decade, has never appeared at general auto shows. And BYD, their Chinese challenger, was similarly nowhere to be seen on the floor. Their absence indicates a world that is passing America by.</p>

<p><strong>The future’s electric</strong></p>

<p>For most of the world, 2025 was a huge year for electric vehicles. In December, sales of new electric cars overtook sales of new petrol cars for the first time ever. The pace of this change is almost unbelievable: as recently as 2022, four new petrol cars were sold for each new electric car. Now, the latter is in the lead.</p>

<p>In China, the biggest single vehicle market after the US (and which is expected to overtake it soon), electric cars already outsold petrol – but by the end of 2025, the sale of fully-electric heavy trucks overtook their diesel equivalents. Trucks carry heavy loads over very long distances, and so were seen as the area least suited for electrification. Chinese makers have shown that’s not so.</p>

<p>Despite the political blowback against net-zero, and hesitation from policymakers on committing to the switch to electric, consumers are voting with their wallets – electric cars are increasingly affordable, look good, perform well, and have the infrastructure to allow people to drive them without worrying about the battery going flat.</p>

<p>At least until we get to America. At the Detroit Auto Show, the big automakers were trying to nod in the direction of an electric future. Front and centre of Ford’s huge array of vehicles was the Mustang Mach-E RTR (“Ready to Rock”), an electric version of its popular crossover SUV. </p>

<p>Jeep similarly had the electric Jeep Recon Moab, the “only fully electric vehicle to be trail rated” for off-roading, as its centrepiece. Both vehicles were accompanied by a mic’d up actor listing their virtues, but both vehicles were largely ignored by showgoers, in favour of the much bigger petrol-fired vehicles behind them.</p>

<p>Stereotypes exist for a reason, and Americans genuinely like big cars. Their roads are set up for them – cities are built on grids, and the interstate network is huge. When everyone else is in a huge car, driving a small car is genuinely less safe – you and your family will come off worse in a crash. A Fiat 500 on display at the auto show was greeted mostly as a novelty, coming off like a toy car compared with pickup trucks larger than some London flats.</p>

<p>American car culture leans big, and Americans drive in ways that Europeans don’t. Few of us in the UK drive for longer than two or three hours at a time, and even journeys of that length are rare. Americans will drive from state to state for ten hours, twelve hours, or far longer, exactly the kind of journeys for which electric vehicles are least suited. With the right charging infrastructure, electric vehicles can do these journeys, just like they can manage heavy trucking and off-roading – but there is still a huge job to do to convince buyers of that.</p>

<p>More than that, the economics of driving in America are simply very different to the rest of the world. The biggest factor in this is the cost of petrol, or “gas” as Americans insist on calling it. A gallon of petrol in America today costs about £2.35. The same amount of fuel in the UK would cost about £5. In France, it would be £5.52, Germany it clocks in at £5.72 and in the Netherlands a gallon of petrol is £6.67. Even in China – where prices at the pump are state controlled – a gallon of petrol is £2.90, a higher cost in a country with much lower average incomes.</p>

<p>Cheaper gas means there is simply less motivation for Americans to switch to electric cars, a factor compounded by the Trump administration withdrawing a federal tax credit worth $7,500 for electric car buyers last year – meaning that they’re now much more expensive. America is simply out of sync with the rest of the world on electric cars, which makes it all the more difficult for American carmakers to dominate in this area.</p>

<p><strong>The elephant in the room</strong></p>

<p>Except that’s not quite been the case for most of the last decade: the world’s most valuable automaker, and the top seller of electric cars has been an American company: Tesla. Elon Musk, the company’s owner (after he bought it out from its original founders) has spent years telling investors that Tesla isn’t a car company – this is part of why it doesn’t appear at auto shows – but to date that’s still the only significant product it has ever brought to market.</p>

<p>Tesla’s Model Y has been the world’s bestselling electric car for years, and Musk long promised to produce a truly mass-market affordable electric car – a “model 2” that would be sold for $20-25,000 and would be available by 2025 or 2026. </p>

<p>This was yet another unfulfilled Musk promise. As the date got closer, Musk got less and less keen on the idea of actually delivering the Model 2. Instead, he started talking about a fully self-driving “cybercab” that could operate as a self-driving taxi when its owner wasn’t using it. </p>

<p>This, he said, would be the future of the company. Until he changed his mind again. He still says the “cybercab” is coming soon, even though full self-driving is not yet a reality on existing models, but it’s no longer the big idea. Instead, the future of Tesla is robotics. Musk is making big promises that Tesla will eventually sell a million humanoid robots, capable of doing pretty much anything, at a price tag of $30,000. </p>

<p>He claims the first will roll off the production line later this year. This combination of big claims, low price tags, and apparently imminent delivery dates will sound very familiar to anyone who has watched Tesla for a long time.</p>

<p>The truth is that Tesla needs a big idea that isn’t cars because its performance as an automaker is genuinely terrible. The last model that Tesla launched was the widely derided Cybertruck, which despite attracting a small devoted fanbase has generally been a commercial failure. </p>

<p>Otherwise, he hasn’t delivered a new model of car since 2020, and despite promised “refreshes” Tesla’s cars look increasingly dated. Sales of its Model S and Model X slumped by almost 50% last year, leading Tesla to announce last month it would be discontinuing both, with no replacements planned. </p>

<p>Tesla car sales globally fell 9% in 2025, the second year running of falling sales, and a figure that was considerably worse in Europe than in other markets. Musk has become a terrible CEO for an electric car company, with a public image that actively repels most prospective buyers of electric vehicles. Tesla’s margins are being squeezed, and Trump’s decision to scrap electric car subsidies means US sales will likely suffer further next year.</p>

<p>Tesla’s decision to skip auto pageants like Detroit used to look like a show of strength – the company didn’t need to be there, and it knew it. Increasingly, though, it just looks like weakness. Tesla has nothing new to show, and its existing lineup doesn’t compare favourably to newer, better cars. That is particularly true when the competition is from China.</p>

<p><strong>It’s BYD you</strong></p>

<p>Most car manufacturers have around a dozen or so major ranges, with variants of each leading to perhaps hundreds of different models. Tesla only really has two models worth noting – the Model 3 and the Model Y. Even after Tesla’s terrible 2025, the Model Y was still the world’s bestselling car. Tesla, and by extension America, is still number one! </p>

<p>Except… it’s really not. Until 2024, Tesla really was the top dog when it came to electric cars, but now it’s a distant second. Globally, Tesla sold just over 1.6 million cars in 2025. BYD, the leading Chinese manufacturer of electric cars, sold 2.25 million – overtaking Tesla for the first time and then beating its sales by 40%. But because BYD has around 30 different models of electric car, there isn’t a single one overtaking the Model Y, at least not yet.</p>

<p>China has taken a lead in the electric car race, and America looks to have almost no hope of catching up – Donald Trump’s policies have actively harmed its domestic market, removed incentives for American producers to switch to electric, and otherwise hamstrung the industry. The White House has been left to threaten countries like Canada for signing deals that will encourage Chinese car imports, despite the US having few competitive products to offer.</p>

<p>Review sites comparing Tesla’s Model 3 with BYD’s flagship Seal – BYD generally doesn’t try to compete directly with the luxury Model Y – generally rate both cars highly, but most say that on balance the Model 3 is still the better car. But in 2026, buying a new Model 3 comes with a lot of baggage, given Musk’s unpopularity and his decision to use his money to directly fund Trump.</p>

<p>Many of those looking at the head-to-head choose BYD. Beyond that, while the Model 3 is Tesla’s entry-level car, BYD has smaller and cheaper options available – while Tesla’s “Model 2” never materialised, the BYD Dolphin is a hatchback that’s on sale today, starting at around £25,000. BYD sells smaller, cheaper electric cars that buyers outside America like. Its success is really as simple as that, though Trump’s endless drama over tariffs must surely also be helping. European markets are not exempt from this new wave of competition – in 2025, the number of cars sold by Stellantis across Europe fell by nearly 6%. </p>

<p>Detroit Auto Show can insist that there’s “ONLY ONE MOTOR CITY” as loudly as it likes. Everyone knows that’s just not true any more. Sorry, Donald, but China is just better at making electric cars than you. And it’s only getting better.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[When I heard that ICE would be attending the 2026 Winter Olympics, I was shocked - but not surprised]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“Did you hear the news, Jess?”, my friend asked me. “There will be ICE at the Winter Olympics.”</p>

<p>At first, it sounded like a bad joke. Call me grumpy, but even with my dark sense of humour, I found it difficult to laugh at jokes involving an agency that put a five-year-old child in custody, dragged a disabled woman from her car, and that shoots innocent people in broad daylight.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>So when I heard that ICE would be attending the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina, I was shocked, but not surprised. Shocked because of the scale of what had already transpired, including the recent killing of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol, an agency closely affiliated with ICE. That Pretti was of Northern Italian descent made the decision feel all the more unsettling.</p>

<p>Unsurprised because of the increasingly cosy relationship between Giorgia Meloni’s government and the US.</p>

<p>Asked about the backlash, the foreign minister Antonio Tajani responded: “I don’t understand – it’s not like the SS are coming.”</p>

<p>The officers coming to Milan belong to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the main investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security. Their role during the games is to provide protection for the US secretary of state Marco Rubio and vice president JD Vance, who both arrived in Milan ahead of the inauguration ceremony.</p>

<p>That clarification, however, has done little to calm public anger.</p>

<p>A week before the opening, Milanese residents took to Piazza XXV Aprile, just outside the city centre. Having attended the <a href="https://www.thenewworld.co.uk/jessica-lionnel-venice-cannot-be-bought-mr-bezos/">Bezos protests</a> in Venice last year, I went to see whether the atmosphere (and the signs) lived up to expectations.</p>

<p>Several thousand protestors had gathered. Some had painted their faces with “ICE out”. Others held placards reading “ICE should be in my drinks, not my city”. </p>

<p>“They think after all they have done, they can show up here and not expect us to be annoyed,” said Vittoria Rossi, from Milan. “I feel ashamed that we have a government that would even allow this. Thankfully humanity is here today.”</p>

<p>“It’s everything bad that could be thought of,” said Maso Notarianni, president of Milan’s ARCI branch, a national non-profit cultural association.</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly well that every nation thinks about its own security. But at the moment, ICE is essentially a force that tramples over the law. It deports people, shoots people in the head, terrorises them.”</p>

<p>“I find their behavior completely inappropriate. The fact that they come here after having already destroyed people’s lives. But honestly, I don’t think this is the right moment for their arrival.”</p>

<p>When the inauguration ceremony took place, JD Vance and his wife, Usha, were booed loudly, the jeers audible above the music. US Olympic athletes have also spoken publicly about the political situation back home.</p>

<p>Protests continued across Milan over the weekend after the opening, with demonstrators throwing stones and flares at police. While ICE remains a central target, opposition has broadened to include anger over the environmental impact of the games themselves.</p>

<p>Italy is also now set to open an investigation into Saturday’s railway sabotage at Bologna Centrale station, which caused major disruption for thousands of passengers during the opening weekend of the games.</p>

<p>The Olympics are promoted as an event that brings the world together. These games suggest the opposite. Rather than neutral ground, the games have become a political stage.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Reform leader says he was offered a safe Tory seat back in 2004. But the Conservatives say he was the one who went to them asking for it]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Nigel Farage, currently hoovering up Tory defectors to his Reform Party, likes to tell the story of how the hunter was once the hunted. Back in 2004, so his story has long gone, a “Tory knight of the shires” approached him with the offer of a safe seat in Farage’s home turf of Kent if he was prepared to abandon UKIP, then under the leadership of the forgotten-to-history Roger Knapman. But Farage stayed loyal and the rest is history.</p>

<p>An exciting tale. But is it true?</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Not so, says the “knight of the shires” himself – Sir Paul Beresford, then MP for Mole Valley, who told <em>Channel 4 News</em> this week that it was Farage who was sniffing around the Tories, rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>“I said to him, ‘look, what do you want?’” Beresford said of his meeting with Farage at the home of a local Conservative councillor, Helyn Clack. “And there’s a deep intake of breath, and he said, ‘I want to be nominated for a solid Conservative seat in Kent. Can you fix that?’</p>

<p>“I mean, I recall that there was a specific seat up for election at Tunbridge Wells,” said Clack.</p>

<p>The claim he was put up by then-Conservative leader Michael Howard to talk Farage into the Tories “is a figment of his imagination,” Beresford says now. Of the idea he approached him, he says: “That is a lie.”</p>

<p>As for Farage, he is sticking to his tale. “They offered me a safe seat,” he insisted to the programme. “They offered me a safe seat which I didn’t take. They are dishonest… if they’re saying that, that sums them up. Dishonest to their back teeth.</p>

<p>“I was approached by a knight of the shires to meet confidentially and offered Tunbridge Wells, and they said ‘you have it on a plate, you’ll be the MP there for as long as you want’. And I said no.”</p>

<p>Beresford says of that: “It’s completely and utterly untrue. Complete opposite of what happened. I had to be asked to come and meet him. I didn’t ask him. I don’t like him, I don’t trust him.”</p>

<p>So who knows who to believe? Although perhaps Robert Jenrick – who still insisted on the phone to his Conservative chief whip the very morning of the day he defected to Farage’s mob that had no intention of doing so – may have taken some advice from the master of dissembling!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A Republican congressman claims Democrats want to get rid of dogs. He was less concerned when one of his own party literally did just that]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Donald Trump’s increasingly unhinged GOP have found another culture war to wage as they face a shellacking in November’s mid-term elections: dogs versus Islam.</p>

<p>Randy Fine, a Republican congressman whose preferred soubriquet for himself – The Hebrew Hammer – is unaccountably even sillier than his actual name, has faced calls to resign after posting, and then doubling down on, that he would choose dogs over Muslims if he was forced to choose.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Fine wrote on, inevitably, X: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one”.</p>

<p>The congressman was responding to Nerdeen Kiswani, a US-Palestinian activist, who had written an apparently satirical (if admittedly not that funny) X post saying: “Finally, NYC is coming to Islam. Dogs definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets. Like we’ve said all along, they are unclean.”</p>

<p>This prompted Fine to make his inflammatory comment, following it up with “We will not be shamed into being conquered like the Europeans. I choose my dog”, and then doubling down on TV. He told the hard right Newsmax channel: “If they’re gonna make us choose between our dogs and them going home, the choice is easy, and people should know: Democrats like AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] are saying ‘we are going to get rid of your dogs’.</p>

<p>“Americans need to keep that in mind when they go to vote in November.”</p>

<p>Curiously, though – and leaving aside that Ocasio-Cortez has never said that anyone is going to get rid of any dogs – Fine appears to have had little to say about one of his party’s leading figures who has <em>actually</em> got rid of a dog.</p>

<p>Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary currently directing Trump’s MAGA militias ICE, admitted killing her dog Cricket, a wirehair pointer, in a book two years ago. In <em>No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward</em>, she tells of killing Cricket, she said, to illustrate her willingness in politics as well as life to do anything “difficult, messy and ugly” if it simply needs to be done.</p>

<p>“I hated that dog,” Noem writes, adding that Cricket had proved herself “untrainable”, “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “less than worthless… as a hunting dog”.</p>

<p>“At that moment,” Noem says, “I realised I had to put her down.” She writes how got her gun, then led Cricket to a gravel pit. “It was not a pleasant job,” she writes, “but it had to be done.”</p>

<p>For some reason, though, Fine appears to have said nothing about the killing of an actual, real dog compared to those referenced in a fatuous social media post by an activist being a bit silly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Yet more shenanigans at Kent Council, the Reform-led local authority which, to be fair, is sticking to its promise to demonstrate what things would look like were the party ever to take office at a national level.</p>

<p>Seven of its former councillors – six of whom were expelled from Nigel Farage’s party last year – have now signed up en masse for Rupert Lowe’s Restore Britain, an even more extreme outlet set up by the Great Yarmouth MP himself given the boot by Reform.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The seven councillors named in a graphic accompanying Lowe’s post include Maxine Fothergill, who Reform said had failed to disclose a “serious matter” during her vetting procedure, and Robert Ford, suspended for alleged complaints by female members which he claimed were related to an “erotic novel” he had penned.</p>

<p>Others are Paul Thomas, Brian Black and Oliver Bradshaw, expelled for showing “a pattern of dishonest and deceptive behaviour which the party will not tolerate”, Dean Burns and Isabella Kemp. All five had fallen out with Reform Kent leader Linden Kemkaran following the leak of a video of a meeting in which she told members unhappy with a proposed rise in council tax to “fucking suck it up”.</p>

<p>Lowe, whose esoteric policies include allowing anyone to kill burglars, abolishing HR departments in private firms, banning the trans pride flag and giving parents “the right to take their children out of school for a limited number of days per year without getting fined”, has cheered his new recruits, saying: “I am delighted to announce that seven Kent County Councillors have today joined Restore Britain, and they will form an official Restore Britain group on the council.</p>

<p>“This is a very important day for our party. There will be many more to come.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Reform UK source said: “Restore are welcome to our dregs. Let’s not forget that six of these councillors were expelled. If this is Restore’s bar for councillors then it must be very low indeed.” Reform watchers may note this is exactly the same language the Conservative employ every time one of their members make the switch to Farage’s turquoise Tories!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 92 per cent of respondents to a JL Partners poll for GB News failed to correctly identify independent Lowe – actually up from the 86 per cent who didn’t have a clue who he was in a similar poll this time last year. Still, at least Ben Habib, the other Reform exile now running a hard-right party, Advance UK, is even less well known: a (surprisingly high) four per cent of respondents recognised him. The pair are currently engaged in an online row as to whose party should be submerged into the other’s.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Saparmurat Niyazov, dictator of Turkmenistan from 1991 to 2006, had a penchant for naming things after himself and his family, including rebranding January after himself, April after his mother and September after his favourite book. Is America’s own carrot-coloured Caligula planning something similar?</p>

<p>In December last year, having sacked all its directors and replaced them with its own, who duly elected him chairman, Trump renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the US’s national cultural centre, after himself.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The Donald J Trump and The John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, as it is now called has since, alas, closed down for two years for “Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding”, as the president put it with his trademark capitalisation, and not at all because pull-outs caused by the new name left it without enough acts to mount a 2026–27 season.</p>

<p>That was followed in January by Trump renaming a road near his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, President Donald J Trump Avenue. Trump said he was “tremendously honoured” by the recognition, despite the idea coming, er, from Donald J Trump. Other things which have had Trump’s name attached to them since the president returned to office include a proposed new class of Navy warships, a visa initiative for affluent foreign nationals, a government-run prescription drug website and federal savings accounts for children.</p>

<p>But now Trump has set his heights (literally) higher: filing three trademark applications that would reserve his name for use as the brand of an airport.</p>

<p>Three applications have just been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on what is known as an “intent to use” basis. This is a strategy which allows applicants to stake a claim to a name before it is used in commerce. The applications, submitted by DTTM Operations LLC on February 13 and 14, seek federal protection for the names ‘President Donald J Trump International Airport’, ‘Donald J Trump International Airport’ and ‘DJT’.</p>

<p>Media reports in the US suggest that Trump is interested in renaming major airports after himself, including Washington’s Dulles International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. The applications were filed by DTTM Operations, his private intellectual property holding company which owns a vast portfolio of trademarks spanning hotels, residential towers and a range of licensed consumer products.</p>

<p>While many presidents have had landmarks named in their honour, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the US sought trademark rights in advance of such naming. The applications mean that if an airport authority were to adopt the name ‘President Donald J Trump International Airport,’ DTTM Operations would now need to license the mark to that authority, no doubt charging a whopping fee. Ker-ching!<br>The only way around this, of course, is for an airport <em>not to want to</em> name itself after the preposterous man-baby. Unless, of course, Trump is planning on buying one?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The pair are squabbling on social media after Turner objected to veteran TV medic Dr Hilary Jones appearing on the channel]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Not for the first time, civil war has broken out in the studios of GB News – and this time it’s more serious than when one presenter accused a colleague of stealing her orange squash.</p>

<p>Bev Turner, the basketball host turned tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist who now works out of the right wing channel’s Washington DC studio, lashed out after veteran TV medic Dr Hilary Jones was booked on to the station by her London colleagues.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Jones, a sofa fixture on ITV’s breakfast shows for over 35 years before leaving last October, popped up on GB News to discuss how to prevent children from getting measles. A large outbreak, mostly affecting unvaccinated kids, has been confirmed in north-east London, with some needing to be admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>His appearance went down well with one of the channel’s presenters. “Great to see popular TV doctor ⁦@DrHilaryJones ex @gmb on ⁦@GBNEWS,” posted Andrew Pierce, who co-hosts the morning <em>Britain’s Newsroom</em> show with former Tory MP Miriam Cates. “More please. He’s trusted &amp; loved by viewers.”</p>

<p>Viewers, perhaps, but perhaps not GB News presenters, some of whom remain aggrieved that, throughout the pandemic, Jones maintained that Covid-19 was a nasty illness and having vaccines to stop catching it and wearing masks to stop spreading it was a good thing to do. </p>

<p>Ben Leo, who hosts the late-night <em>Late Edition</em>, was the first to wade in on behalf of GB News’s anti-vax warriors, responding to Pierce: “Not sure he’s loved by the viewers who contact me. </p>

<p>“I remember trying to doorstep Hilary during the height of Covid after I’d just joined GB News. His behaviour during that period was questionable, to say the least. Does he still think we should wear facemasks in the sea?”</p>

<p>Leo was followed – as indeed he is in the schedule, in the midnight to 2am graveyard slot – by Turner, an anti-vax crackpot who has variously claimed that they were not effective and that the virus itself appeared to have been bioengineered to be less dangerous to some Jewish people.</p>

<p>In a lengthy and arguably defamatory diatribe in response, Turner wrote that “news channels build trust over time by listening to viewers and striving for truth – even if that means saying the opposite of all other outlets” (this last bit is certainly true for Turner – the only news anchor in the UK to echo Vladimir Putin’s language that his war on Ukraine is a “special military operation”).</p>

<p>“@DrHilaryJones was wrong on TV every day for 2 years,” she went on. “He unnecessarily scared millions of people, breaking up families via fear and causing untold death and injury by amplifying ‘covid’ risk and peddling the mrna onto all age groups.</p>

<p>“Everything he said during that time was based on propoganda [sic] rather than scientific evidence. I’d be thrilled to see him apologise to the nation for the significant role he played during that time. I’d be thrilled to interview him about why he ignored true infection fatality data and the evidence within Pfizer’s own 2020 trials. </p>

<p>“But otherwise, in my view, he should not be welcome in a building which prides itself on freedom and truth.” (That’s GB News’s Paddington studios, presumably.)</p>

<p>Jones’s booking sparked plenty of comments from GB News viewers pledging to switch off in their droves, prompted by their favourite hard right conspiracy channel turning woke. “GB News has become another legacy media channel, what differentiates them from the rest now,” wrote one, while others moaned “Do better or lose viewers!”, “GBNEWS is falling into line with the BBC and other Propaganda platforms” and “turned to this station because BBC had lost all credibility”.</p>

<p>Will that concern GB News even more than the fact that, once again, the only things its presenters hate more than wokery is each other? Depends on who they back on this one – Turner, the presenter who did a prize interview with US president Donald Trump very recently, or Pierce, who himself departed <em>Good Morning Britain</em> just last year when GB News slapped exclusive TV handcuffs on him.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[There is a strong anti-military strain in German culture and the introduction of national service has not been popular. But times have changed]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Wedding is one of Berlin’s less touristy neighbourhoods. Proudly radical and working class, it was a stronghold of Communist resistance in the Weimar Republic and was nicknamed “Red Wedding”. Today it’s home to neon-lit Turkish supermarkets, digital start-ups and a growing cultural scene.  </p>

<p>One of my favourite hangouts there is a concert hall in the chapel of an old crematorium, called Silent Green. Experimental films now flicker in the concrete tunnels of the former mortuary. Across the district, abandoned factories have been repurposed as creative spaces: Panke Hallen, which used to make safes and cash-registers, is now a sculpture workshop, while a 19th-century chemical works houses studios for 70 artists.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>One factory, which used to make car parts, stands out. The Pierburg plant is being retooled – not for art, but for war. Its production line, which once specialised in environmentally friendly throttle valves, will soon be churning out artillery shells instead. It’s owned by the country’s biggest defence company, Rheinmetall, which has seen its share price surge as the German government pours billions into rearmament. </p>

<p>Nearly four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe is rearming at its fastest rate since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Germany is spearheading the effort and plans to spend around £190bn a year to build up its army. By 2029, the country’s overall defence budget will be about 3.5% of its GDP – double that of the UK. It is a huge jump from just 1.3% at the start of the decade. In his first speech to parliament after he was elected as chancellor last May, Friedrich Merz pledged to turn the Bundeswehr into “the strongest conventional army in Europe.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.igmetall-berlin.de/betriebsraete-vertrauensleute/meldung/aus-pierburg-gmbh-wird-die-rheinmetall-waffen-munitions-gmbh">metal workers union at the Wedding plant</a> have accepted the conversion and a new contract, which promises state of the art machinery and job security for the 350 employees. “It’s not the transformation we expected”, said Bernd Benninghaus, the chairman of the works council, “but there’s no alternative”.</p>

<p>Given Chinese competition in the car industry, he was preparing the workers for the phasing out of production and ultimately negotiations for a social plan leading to complete closure. </p>

<p>Yet many of the factory’s neighbours oppose the plan. Although Rheinmetall says no explosives will be used on site, some worry that weapons production in such a densely populated area could make the neighbourhood a target. </p>

<p>I met Niklas and his friend Eden in a nearby café. Both are members of the left-wing party Die Linke and told me their government had its priorities wrong. “Why does nobody care about child poverty or leaking school ceilings?” Eden asks. “Or that train fares are unaffordable?” Niklas adds: “We don’t want weapons mass-produced here just so capitalists can make a profit.”</p>

<p>We finished our coffee and walked over to the factory, with its saw-toothed roof, surrounded by spiked railings. As I took out my phone, a security guard in a glass booth waved his arms, warning me not to take pictures. The Berlin Alliance Against Arms Production – made up of some 30 grassroots groups – has already held protests outside the gates, with people holding signs saying “War Starts Here”, “Money for the Neighbourhood – Instead of Weapons for War” and “Disarm Rheinmetall”. </p>

<p>At a demonstration in October, Cem Ince, a member of the Bundestag from Salzgitter and a member of Die Linke in Lower Saxony was briefly arrested, allegedly for attacking police officers. The MP responded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPuDVGhjVEq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==">on social media</a>, saying he was “forcibly dragged out of the demonstration” and punched in the face even though he was clearly identified as a parliamentary observer. </p>

<p>Tensions are running high, with many Germans alarmed by what they see as the country’s creeping militarisation. It is not just that civilian industries are being redirected toward arms production – the transformation involves people too. For forty years, west Berlin welcomed draft-dodgers. An island inside East Germany, the city came under the protective umbrella of the western allied forces. </p>

<p>A decade after reunification, military service was suspended but now a form of conscription is making a comeback. Pupils in schools in 90 German cities <a href="https://www.kas.de/en/in-short/detail/-/content/youth-protests-against-military-service">recently went on strike</a> when the Bundestag voted to introduce voluntary military service. </p>

<p>Starting this month, all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. If security deteriorates or too few people step up, the Bundestag could move to compulsory military service – a prospect that appalls young Germans like Niklas. </p>

<p>He suggests that with Germany’s dark past and the rise of the far right AfD party, having a powerful army is not a great idea. It’s a familiar argument. So is all the graffiti saying <em>Nie Wieder</em> (“Never Again!”) on walls and monuments. After the Second World War, Germany embraced pacifism as a form of atonement. But that was when the American troops stationed in barracks across the country guaranteed security. In today’s world, if Vladimir Putin decides to attack a Nato state, it is far from certain that a US president would ride to the rescue. </p>

<p>More guns, less butter is always a hard sell. I tell Niklas and Eden that I used to share their revulsion of the military industrial complex but the assurances we once relied on are gone. My three trips to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion have changed me. There, I have seen for myself how men and women desperately trying to defend their land are dying needlessly because of diminishing supplies of ammunition. </p>

<p>“We want sovereignty for all people, but we are against weapons,” says Niklas. Walking back to the U-Bahn station, I think of the endless rows of blue and yellow flags, photos and candles next to freshly dug graves across Ukraine. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[Taxi Driver is 50 years old but its main character’s sexless white supremacy makes it more relevant than ever. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“Are you talking to me?” A man stands in front of a mirror, rehearsing a confrontation. He is an actor – Robert De Niro – playing a man – Travis Bickle – who is performing a part like a bad actor in the revenge movies that were all the rage in the seventies. </p>

<p>Bickle’s masculinity is in its mirror phase. He’s trying to fine-tune it, find a role which will project power into the world, power he doesn’t naturally have. He wants to be an Alpha. He trains himself with masochistic routines.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>He writes in his diary: “June 29th. I gotta get in shape now. Too much sitting has ruined my body. Too much abuse has gone on for too long. From now on it’ll be 50 push-ups each morning, 50 pull-ups. There will be no more pills, there will be no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body. From now on it’ll be total organisation. Every muscle must be tight.” </p>

<p>If Travis Bickle was alive today he wouldn’t have a podcast, but he’d listen to them 24/7 and I don’t even have to tell you which ones. </p>

<p>Fifty years ago, Martin Scorsese’s <em>Taxi Driver </em> hit screens and today it is more relevant than ever. Written by transcendental nihilist Paul Schrader and starring the young Robert De Niro, the film was zeitgeist then and is zeitgeist now. It was New York, post-Vietnam urban alienation, with a grimy glamour or glamorous grime, sleazed up by Psycho-composer Bernard Hermann’s last score. It possesses an all-things-to-all-men politics. </p>

<p>You can cheer Travis’ monologues of misogyny and racism or deplore it: “All the animals come out at night: whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies… sick, venal.” The depth of Dostoyevsky – “I’m God’s lonely man” – at the service of the urges of Michael Winner’s Death Wish, delivering a portrait in male loneliness and alienation with both detachment and intimacy. </p>

<p>The detachment is there from the start. We see the main character from angles that aren’t quite right. The film might edit him as he walks down the street, as he zones in and out. We hear his voiceover delivered in an affectless voice, reading his journal like a child reading out his homework – hesitant at times, finding a decisiveness only in rage, but a blank rage, not impassioned. </p>

<p>We don’t know much about him. He has no friends, no family. He claims to be a vet of the Vietnam war in his job interview and wears a military jacket, but the jacket could have been picked up in any thrift store and since when has anyone told the truth in a job interview?  In Cinema Speculation, Quentin Tarantino argues that Bickle’s inability to deal with black people rules out a tour of duty in Vietnam. </p>

<p>Vietnam was a problem for the menly-men of New Hollywood. Machismo was to be had in the army and their dads’ wars in Europe and the Pacific served as precedents, but no one really wanted to go and get killed in south-east Asia. </p>

<p>John Milius, who wrote the first two first two <em>Dirty Harry</em> films and co-wrote <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, spent all his time shooting guns off and talking about being a warrior poet, but when it came to Vietnam, he was rejected because he had asthma. Scorsese also had asthma and was happy to stay home watching and making films.</p>

<p>Schrader also got a medical deferral but has used the image of the Vietnam veteran as a way of embodying retributive violence in <em>Taxi Driver </em>and in <em>Rolling Thunder</em>, a proto-<em>First Blood </em>prefiguring Sylvester Stallone’s fantasy figure John Rambo. Sly also never went to Vietnam, getting a medical deferral and spending the war as a PE teacher in Switzerland, which is, if you think about it, the opposite of going to Vietnam. </p>

<p>John Wayne – quite rightly – got no end of aggro for being a patriotic blowhard while at the same time skipping out on world war two. He also made a laughably bad film about Vietnam, but he had this over the New Hollywood lads: he did actually visit the country.</p>

<p>Like Milius, Schrader became something of a gun nut and let it be known that while writing <em>Taxi Driver</em>, he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow; to which the only response is: “oooh hard.” In <em>Mr Runner-Up</em>, a 2016 episode of the spoof series <em>Documentary Now!,</em> a version of Schrader is shown who can only write screenplays by tapping on the typewriter keys with two loaded handguns.  </p>

<p>Bickle works as a New York taxi driver, taking shift after shift, an insomniac pill-popper. He goes to porn theaters when off work. If he’s scared of black folks, his relationship with women is terrified. </p>

<p>He falls – at a distance – for Betsy, played by Cybil Shepherd. She is described in the screenplay as cover-girl-beautiful, who is always assessing men for their potential: “Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, a star-fucker of the highest order.”</p>

<p>Leave aside the misogyny (actually, don’t leave it aside, underline it – I shall return to it later), it makes the least credible part of the film even less credible. How does Betsy find anything remotely attractive about our taxi driver? Is it just that he looks like Robert De Niro? How doesn’t she pick up on how weird and dumb this man is? When she agrees to a date, he takes her to see a porno, obvs.</p>

<p>The other significant female in his life is the 12-year-old sex worker Iris, played by Jodie Foster. Once he’s been definitively rejected by his Aryan ideal of womanhood, Betsy, he starts to obsess about Iris, the child he wants to rescue from her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel). In the script, Iris is 14 and has a nude scene revealing her breasts like “two young doves hiding from a winter wind.” You can hear the pistols rattling as Schrader tapped that line out. Jesus indeed wept. </p>

<p>When Travis talks to Iris, he’s more or less on the same level. As his childish handwriting indicates, Travis is not particularly developed. Even when he goes to the porno theatres, he watches from between his fingers and eats candy like a kid. </p>

<p>None of this is to say that <em>Taxi Driver</em> is a bad film. It isn’t. In fact, it’s a masterpiece. It’s just that what it is showing us has changed in the half-century that has passed.</p>

<p>What its writer and director intended is no longer what we experience watching it. Then it was the backwash of the ‘60s and the hippies – Iris is a hippy prostitute and Betsy is a product of women’s lib as seen through a chauvinistic lens. </p>

<p>Bickle himself was seen as an anti-hero: a poster-boy for alienation and a proto-punk icon. He’s inarticulate, except for his exercise books. When given an opportunity by a politician to voice his prime concern, all he can come up with is the gripe that New York is smelly.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we’d call Bickle an incel. This neologism was first coined by a woman called Alana in the ‘90s to describe an online community for the lonely and involuntarily celibate, or incel, which soon morphed to incel. The idea was to support this neglected community and help them. </p>

<p>But through the years, the term was co-opted by an increasingly aggressive group of men who indulged in misogyny and blamed feminism for their plight and despised women, who are on the lookout for “Chads,” the high-status males attractive to “starfuckers” like Betsy. When an incel becomes convinced of the permanence of their inceldom, they are described as black-pilled.</p>

<p>In 2014, Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 14 more before taking his own life in Isla Vista, California. He recorded a video message immediately before embarking on the spree, identifying as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto.  </p>

<p>Travis Bickle has similar energy. His voiceovers wouldn’t look out of place on a Reddit board. Once Betsy has rejected him, he’s effectively black-pilled. His relationship with Iris isn’t sexual but pre-sexual. He wants to take her back to her childhood. His championing of Iris is like the QAnon conspiracist willing to believe all sorts of guff about pizza parlours.  </p>

<p>There are other parallels. The other taxi drivers are casually racist, homophobic and sexist, but Bickle is a full-on white supremacist who hankers for extermination: “Someday, a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.” </p>

<p>Sport has called him “cowboy” because of his boots, but why does he cut his hair into a mohawk? Scorsese has referred to a group of GIs who would adopt the haircut if given a particularly dangerous mission as inspiration, but it could also be seen as his going native, American Shaman style. It is the pre-mass murder. This is someone who no longer wants to affiliate himself with anything or anyone. He’s ready to go on the rampage.</p>

<p>The nihilism of <em>Taxi Driver </em>makes the film more urgent now than it has been since its release. Rewatching it, we see Travis Bickle asking, “Are you talking to me?” We might not want to talk to him, but the film is definitely talking to us. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[The former president made some comments about extraterrestrial life on a podcast and a lot of people got very excited for all the wrong reasons]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Barack Obama says aliens exist! Not undocumented immigrants to the US (although of course they do too), but aliens of the outer-space variety. In a “rapid-fire” Q&amp;A during an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen broadcast on 4 February, Obama was asked “Are aliens real?” “They’re real”, the ex-president responded, “but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in Area 51 [the US air force site in Nevada that has become the focus of many alien conspiracy theories]. There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”</p>

<p>It was clearly a light-hearted answer, and the absurd headlines Obama’s comments provoked (“‘They’re real’: Barack Obama’s shock alien claims”) speak volumes about the crude level of public discourse on the subject. Such was the feverish response that Obama felt obliged to issue a clarification: “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>That’s a sensible and informed view, and speaks to an ongoing debate among scientists. The universe is indeed vast – no one knows just how vast – and it is evidently thronging with stars that have solar systems of planets like that of our own Sun. Thanks to astronomical instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope, we now know of more than 6,000 known “extrasolar” planets, and it’s generally thought that nearly all of the hundreds of billions of stars in each of the trillions of galaxies in the observable universe will host some.</p>

<p>But for planets to host life, they must have habitable conditions. Quite what counts as habitable is not clear. Many researchers believe it demands liquid water, meaning the planet can’t be too hot (like Mercury) or too cold (like the dwarf planet Pluto). But others speculate that other liquids, existing outside the temperature range of liquid water – such as the liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn’s moon Titan – might act as the solvent for alien life forms quite unlike those on Earth. Meanwhile, other moons in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s Europa and Ganymede, and Saturn’s Enceladus, seem to have global oceans of liquid water beneath an icy crust, even though their parent planets lie outside the “habitable zone” (neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water) of the solar system. Such moons boost the potential tally of inhabitable worlds even further.</p>

<p>And we can be confident that, even if Earth-like extrasolar planets – rocky, with oceans of water – are in a small minority among alien worlds, there will still be vast numbers of them. But how likely is it that life will have begun on any of them? Some astrobiologists – scientists studying the prospects of extraterrestrial life – think the origin of life on Earth was an extraordinarily unlikely, chance event. Others argue that life is almost inevitable when the conditions are amenable. They point to geological evidence suggesting life began almost as soon as it became possible at all once our planet had cooled from its fiery birth.</p>

<p>But even if life is common on other habitable worlds, the chance that it would become intelligent – as we like to consider ourselves – is far less clear. An argument proposed by cosmologist Brandon Carter in the 1980s implies that for life evolving by Darwinian natural selection to get to our level of complexity and intelligence demands that it pass through several unlikely “bottlenecks” in the evolutionary process. In this view, we are only here pondering these questions because we’re the lucky ones who made it when most alien life got stuck at the level of bacteria and algae. Recently, however, other scientists have challenged Carter’s “hard steps” hypothesis, saying that on the contrary it might be common for Darwinian evolution to deliver high intelligence, given enough time.</p>

<p>When we speak of “aliens”, it’s typically this intelligent variety we have in mind – no one seems to care much about alien slime that will never build spaceships. Obama is right that “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there” – that’s an uncontroversial, even if not universal, scientific view. He’s also right that the physical obstacles to interstellar travel by intelligent aliens look daunting, perhaps insurmountable. The only reason we got excited about a US president saying such things is that it seems like a wink at Area 51 conspiracy theories. But for that sort of thing – witness Trump’s past interest in the US military’s “UFO files” – we’re looking at the wrong president. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[With his own man as chair of the Federal Reserve, the president opens up the most damaging prospect of all – that the White House wants to manipulate the currency for political ends]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>A few years ago, during Trump pt1, I was sitting in a restaurant with Michael Lewis, author of <em>Liar’s Poker</em>, <em>Moneyball</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Big Short</em>, and we were talking about the weird new US president.</p>

<p>Trump, he pointed out, was essentially an anti-institutions man. The media, the universities, the law – any institution of public life that checked his power, he instinctively hated and wanted to reduce to a pile of smoking rubble.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Events have proved Lewis correct. But he also made another prediction, which at the time seemed more outlandish: that the one institution of US public life that Trump had not yet attacked was the dollar, and it was inevitable that at some point he would screw that up as well.</p>

<p>It looks as if that prediction is coming true. The dollar has already fallen 2% this year. Throughout 2025, it dropped by 9%. There could be worse to come.</p>

<p>Trump, of course, reckons this is fantastic news, and has said it’s “great” for the US, because “you make a hell of a lot more money with a weaker dollar”. And in one sense, he’s right. If your currency has dropped in value, then the stuff you sell overseas becomes cheaper, which means you can sell more of it – or you can sell the same amount, but for a higher price. </p>

<p>But the flip side of that is the stuff you import becomes more expensive, and all the more so if you have slapped tariffs on foreign imports, which Trump has done. Expensive imports drive up inflation, as US shoppers are currently discovering. A recent report by the New York Federal Reserve Bank found that almost 90% of the cost of Trump’s tariffs had in fact fallen on American consumers.</p>

<p>But the much more uncomfortable question is <em>why </em>the dollar is looking so weak, especially as all the overall US economic numbers look so strong – Goldman Sachs reckons GDP growth in 2026 will be 2.5%, which is robust.</p>

<p>The trouble is that, despite the Trumpian razzmatazz, the weak dollar indicates a fundamental global uncertainty about the US. Trump makes America look risky. The US is not only suffering from stubbornly high inflation, which Trump has made worse, but it’s also in the throes of an AI boom, driven by technology companies that are investing vast amounts of money in <em>each other</em>. </p>

<p>The White House view seems to be that the interests of the Silicon Valley tech bros are aligned with the interests of America. But they are not. The soaring share prices of those firms are beginning to look so bizarre and untenable that they now pose a systemic risk, especially when their colossal spending plans are factored in. The AI industry could well be heading towards its day of reckoning – its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment">Minsky moment</a>.</p>

<p>The threat of an impending stock market implosion is not great, especially as so many ordinary Americans own shares. Even worse is the US debt pile, which according to the US Treasury currently stands at $38.49 trillion, a number so vast that it is essentially meaningless. To give some idea of what $38.49 trillion actually means, if you imagine that a million dollars is a cube of bills about three feet square, then a <em>billion</em> dollars would be a pillar three feet wide, but three thousand feet high. That’s just over half a mile.</p>

<p>Keeping the same footprint, a <em>trillion</em> dollars would be a stack of dollar bills three feet wide but three million feet high, which means it would rise to an altitude of 568 miles. That is beyond the orbit of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight pillars of dollar bills, each of them 568 miles high, is a lot of money. And when you add to that Trump’s statement that he plans to increase US defence spending to $1.5 trillion <em>a year</em>, then you come fairly quickly to the question of where the hell the US is going to borrow all that money from. </p>

<p>Most US government debt is bought by American companies, and around a third is bought by foreign investors. But if Trump is weakening the dollar, this will reduce the international incentive to own anything valued in dollars, because when the dollar value is converted back into pounds or euros or yuan, you get stuffed by the crappy exchange rate. Why buy US government bonds to fund Trump’s ballooning deficit if they’re only going to drop in value?</p>

<p>And right on cue, the latest guidance by the Chinese banking authorities urged the country’s financial institutions to reduce purchases of US government debt. If necessary, they were advised to sell holdings of US Treasuries to limit their exposure.</p>

<p>Things have not been helped by Trump’s persistent attacks on the chair of the Federal Reserve Bank, Jay Powell. Powell’s crime has been his failure to cut interest rates. In Trump’s mind, interest rate cuts create economic booms – but this is rather like smashing open the dashboard of a car and pushing up the speedometer in the hope of making it go faster.</p>

<p>Powell managed to fend off Trump’s call for rate cuts, but he is scheduled to step down in May. It is possible that Trump might try to remove him before his term expires, but that now seems unlikely.</p>

<p>However the timing works out, Powell’s successor will be Kevin Warsh, the son-in-law of the billionaire Ronald Lauder, who happens to be a close friend of Trump’s. It was Lauder who first proposed the idea of the US taking Greenland. (That madcap idea also led to investors selling the dollar.)</p>

<p>Warsh is a career bank regulator, and is by no means a partisan hack of the kind Trump has installed elsewhere in his administration. But, like Trump, Warsh is known to want lower interest rates. Also like Trump, he is prone to making fairly radical statements, for instance when he told CNBC television that it was time for “regime change at the Fed”, a soundbite perfectly tailored to fit Trump’s anti-institutional instincts. “It’s not just about a person,” Warsh continued, “it’s about an approach to economics.”</p>

<p>The worry is that, having installed Warsh, Trump will lean on him to cut rates as fast as possible, a very bad idea when you are facing stubbornly high inflation. In a recent interview with NBC News, Trump said the US central bank should be independent “in theory”. But the Fed, he remarked, should really follow his lead, because, the president said, he understands the US economy “better than almost anybody”. </p>

<p>When asked directly about interest rates, Trump said: “I just think they’re going to be lowered. I mean, they should be lower.” At another press event in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that Warsh “certainly wants to cut rates – I’ve been watching him for a long time.” In February, analysts at State Street warned that aggressive US interest rate cuts could cause the dollar to fall this year by up to 10%.</p>

<p>Global markets now face an unsettling possibility: that an impulsive, deeply unstable and economically illiterate president intends to fiddle with the dollar, and that his new, pliant central bank head will play along. If this happens, then the free market dream of the Reagan-Greenspan era will have curdled into a new form of authoritarian command economy. </p>

<p>The last strong-man leader to try this approach was president Erdoğan of Turkey, who also lost patience with his central bank and insisted that the cure for inflation was a cut in interest rates – which is, essentially, Trump’s current argument. Turkish inflation shot up to over 40%. Having realised his mistake, Erdoğan has since allowed rates to increase to deal with the inflationary problem. They currently stand at a crushing 37%.</p>

<p>So it looks as if Michael Lewis may have got it right. Trump is debasing the dollar, a currency that has become what the analyst Karl Schamotta of Corpay has called “a falling chainsaw” – no one wants to catch it. </p>

<p>So far, Trump’s second term has involved vicious attacks on sections of US society that MAGA voters see as the enemy. But if the dollar, the AI bubble and the US markets all hit trouble, and with inflation still high and job numbers looking weak, the economic pain will hit everyone – including Trump’s own supporters. That could prove decisive for the mid-term elections which, it should be remembered, take place in November. Hopefully.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[London could have been the EU’s capital, leading the continent’s defence against Putin and Trumpworld, instead of a spectator to decisions it once helped to shape]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Somewhere in an alternate universe, Britain is currently the most important country in Europe.</p>

<p>10 years on from the Brexit referendum, now’s a good time to take stock of where Britain stands on a world stage that has become both less predictable and more dangerous.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>A good starting point for understanding exactly where exiting the European Union has left us is to consider the counterfactual – what Britain’s role in the world would be, were we still inside the EU.</p>

<p>The most obvious disruption to the entire continent since 2016 has been Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has asked difficult questions about Europe’s ability to end itself at a time the continent has become estranged from its most important security partner, the United States. For many diplomats and officials, Vladimir Putin’s expansionist aggression has woken Europe from its security slumber and underscored exactly how vulnerable decades of piecemeal defence spending and complacency – the comfortable assumptions that aggressors like Russia and Iran would never attack us, and that even if they did, America has our back.</p>

<p>“These days the EU is necessarily playing a much greater role in security,” Robert Pszczel, a former Nato official and Polish diplomat. “Not just in terms of financing, but also laying the groundwork for the EU carrying out operational tasks.”</p>

<p>Pszczel says that if Britain were still in the EU, its “wise counsel would be valued” by allies like Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Poland, as our battle experience and larger defence budget would help frontier states and hawkish countries push back against unrealistic or bad ideas from other member states – and the EU institutions themselves.</p>

<p>“Some of those ideas imply almost burying Nato today- let’s develop EU collective defence mandate now, establish EU military commands duplicating Nato structures or creating a European army,” he says. “Such a formation does not exist even within Nato. Governments will not relinquish their constitutional duties. Britain would help push back against silly ideas.”</p>

<p>Had Brexit not happened, the modern politics of Europe and the wider world would have left London as potentially the most important capital on the continent. While talk of a Eurosceptic tidal wave crashing across Europe is often overstated, there has been an undeniable drift across the bloc where now, many member states share the standoffish view of Brussels that Britain had during its time as a member state.</p>

<p>“It’s not a question in my mind,” says a senior European diplomat. “Britain would be having a major moment.</p>

<p>“ Lots of member states previously shared the UK’s sceptical view of ever-closer union and Brussels overreach. They were able to hide behind Britain as it stood up for national sovereignty within the EU. I have no doubt, when you look at the politics of Europe as it currently is, that trend would have continued and Britain would have lots of allies who would support its agenda for the whole of the EU.”</p>

<p>This view is common among diplomats and officials. If you look at virtually any of the main issues Europe faces in 2026, the British position is more or less the norm: support for Ukraine; standing up to Russia; immigration; protectionism on trade; a changed approach to the green agenda. Multiple officials also pointed to Britain’s unique relationship with America and the ability of leaders to win over Donald Trump and limit the damage of some of his bigger tantrums.</p>

<p>If a leading role in Europe that could be leveraged on the world stage is what we could have won, what have we lost? How have things changed for us and what has become of Global Britain?</p>

<p>Nigel Sheinwald, an experienced diplomat who has served as the UK’s ambassador to both the US and the EU, sees the timing of leaving the EU as particularly unfortunate, given what has happened geopolitically since 2016.</p>

<p>“Brexit was bound to reduce the UK’s impact because it severely weakened our role in our home region. But the problem was made much worse by the timing – as we entered Trumpworld in which America’s traditional alliances have been downgraded, and as the international landscape has become more divided and geopolitical,” he says. “The UK is unanchored and weaker economically and so struggles to make its undoubted assets (diplomacy, security, intelligence) count.”</p>

<p>Of course, the UK has not become an irrelevance, far from it. We are still a nuclear power with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. We are still a G7 country and an important economic partner that other countries seek to trade with, invest in and work alongside on key issues.</p>

<p>“On European security, a post-Brexit UK can reasonably claim it has played a leadership role – its support for Ukraine in the early stages of the war galvanised other governments: it set the pace by sending tanks and longer-range missiles to Ukraine sooner than other allies,” says Chatham House’s Olivia O’Sullivan.  She does, however, caveat this by saying “there’s no real argument that EU membership would have been a barrier to doing this if the UK had stayed in.”</p>

<p>One area where the UK has become undeniably weaker because of Brexit is economically. The economic downsides of Brexit are well known – and have consequences beyond making British people poorer.</p>

<p>“A prosperous country is more secure and more able to fund defence, diplomacy, and aid. But also, because the UK left a larger trade bloc just as global trade has become more volatile and weaponised,” says O’Sullivan.  “Although no country or bloc has a perfect way to respond to either Trump’s tariffs or the pervasive threat of economic coercion from Chinese supply chain dominance, the EU has the economic heft to at least in theory respond in kind.”</p>

<p>The China question has unquestionably become more complicated for Britain since leaving the EU. America has become more volatile and protectionist on trade as we have erected barriers between us and our closest neighbours. The trade deals signed with other countries do not, by any economist’s calculation, make up for the hit to GDP we’ve suffered as a consequence of Brexit.</p>

<p>China, a country we now recognise as a problematic security risk, is now seen by many as a necessity if Britain is to avoid getting squashed between America and the EU, with whom increasing or restoring our trade relationships comes with political complications of our own making.</p>

<p>Chinese president Xi Jinping is aware of this and is willing to exploit what it sees as a perceived weakness. “Beijing wants to get the UK (and/or the EU) not to side with the USA. But it sees London as the softer underbelly, as the UK is more receptive to Chinese investments and partnerships,” says Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute.</p>

<p>Many have tried, but it is hard to make any credible case that the UK has become a stronger nation and more assertive on the world stage since leaving the EU. Even the claimed benefits, like leading efforts for Ukraine or speedy vaccine rollouts, are easily fact-checked and debunked after five minutes on Google.</p>

<p>It is likely that Britain will at some point reopen the European question. That is another article for another time. But 10 years later, it is now reasonable to take stock of our decision to leave the EU and ask not only what we have really got from it, but also how likely we are to see any benefits from it in the next 10 years.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The former chair of the US National Intelligence Council says that America’s security apparatus is so damaged the UK is holding back intelligence from the US]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>I worked in US intelligence agencies for half a century, starting as a member of the Senate investigation into intelligence practices in the 1970s. Then I became a consumer of intelligence on the National Security Council staff, eventually becoming chair of the National Intelligence Council (NIC), America’s top intelligence analysis agency. </p>

<p>If presidents wanted to know the CIA view on a particular issue, they could simply ask it. But there are seventeen intelligence agencies in the US, and if you wanted to know what they all think, then the question then went to the NIC. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Watching the Trump administration destroy the US intelligence system is a personal sadness as well as a national disaster. Under the banner of “depoliticising” intelligence, the administration has not just politicised intelligence but weaponized it. </p>

<p>I knew this was coming. I received my first security clearance, Top Secret plus access to Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence (TS-SCI) more than fifty years ago. On Inauguration Day, Donald Trump’s executive order revoked those clearances, accusing me and fifty other intelligence veterans of having “willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.”  </p>

<p>What was my alleged offense? In October 2020 I had signed a letter with those fifty colleagues in which we expressed the opinion that the laptop purporting to belong to Hunter Biden, and which press reporting suggested contained emails showing that the son had used his father’s presidency for personal gain, and that his father was aware of it, “had all the hallmarks of a Russian influence operation”. </p>

<p>What we expressed on the Hunter Biden issue was an <em>opinion</em>, our assessment as experienced intelligence professionals. In the years since the letter I have been occasionally harassed by Fox or <em>New York Post </em>reporters asking whether I regretted signing. I always gave the same answer: what we said in 2020 was true and still is. </p>

<p>In fact, it <em>did </em>have the hallmarks of a Russian influence operation, and our assessment was reinforced by the fact that my last service in government was supervising the report on the three-pronged Russian attack designed to influence our 2016 elections. Trump still lies about that attack, calling it a hoax.</p>

<p>For me, losing the clearance was no big deal. Sure, I lost some mentoring work I was doing, but I’ve been inclined to keep my head down, all the more so because for the first time I felt physical danger. </p>

<p>The Trump administration didn’t stop with us 51 letter-signers. Later it removed clearances from my vice chair at the NIC, a distinguished CIA officer who was Trump’s briefer in his first term. My NIC colleague in charge of cyber also had his clearance nullified. He was an NSA analyst who had been recruited at 17.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tulsi Gabbard is the current director of national intelligence. She has no qualifications for that job.</p>

<p>The dismantling of US intelligence is most visible at the FBI, where the fifty-year effort to remove the Bureau from partisan politics has been reversed. As officers have been reassigned to border or immigration missions, not only has intelligence suffered but so has law enforcement: there is no better time to be a white-collar criminal.</p>

<p>The acting chair and vice chair of the NIC, both distinguished CIA analysts, were fired, and so far as I can tell the NIC has all but disappeared. The president does not read, and so whether he receives his president’s daily brief is also unclear. </p>

<p>Former allies, like Britain, have stopped sharing intelligence on, for example, Caribbean issues, and Senator Ron Wyden has raised critical questions about whether the CIA overstepped its bounds in the seizure of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. </p>

<p>What we know is that intelligence is ignored or dismissed if it questions the president’s whims. The damage to institutions that the nation needs, and about which I care, is enormous. This will take a generation to repair. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Matthew Goodwin is among the highest-profile by-election candidates of the last couple of decades – but only if you belong to a certain group of people. The former academic turned firebrand blogger and GB News broadcaster is certainly better known among the media and political elites he loves to castigate than among the general public.</p>

<p>He recently declared that he would rather shoot himself in the head “than be at some dinner party table with Nick Robinson and Mary Beard”. But it is an unusual novice parliamentary candidate who has already recorded a 45-minute <em>Political Thinking</em> BBC podcast with the same Nick Robinson before having faced the voters in any electoral contest.<br><br>Goodwin’s reputation as a controversial voice may have hindered Reform’s constituency campaign in Gorton &amp; Denton more than it has helped it. “You spent so long Matt, I think, researching far right extremism that you did get a little bit confused and thought what you were reading was an instruction manual”, his Green Party opponent Hannah Spencer jibed at last week’s <em>Manchester Evening News</em> hustings.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Having declared Englishness an ethnicity, not a national identity, Goodwin ignored Keir Starmer’s challenge to say whether he believes Manchester-born United hero Marcus Rashford can not be English. The campaign has been further damaged by revelations about social media posts by his interim campaign manager in Tameside, Adam Mitula, which include use of the n-word and a declaration that he would “never touch a Jewish woman”.<br><br>Goodwin’s by-election opponents challenged him to reject the personal – albeit unsolicited – “vote for Matt” endorsement from Tommy Robinson. Yet Nigel Farage said he was “not bothered” by the endorsement. Goodwin ducked offering any substantive comment, beyond reiterating that Reform had not allowed Robinson to join the party.<br><br>That silence may reflect an electoral dilemma: Reform voters nationally are split over Robinson, with a third positive, a third negative and a third on the fence about him, according to polling for More in Common. Robinson has joined another political party – Advance UK – whose candidate Nick Buckley, once Reform’s mayoral candidate in Greater Manchester, is championing Advance’s new maximalist hardline immigration policy: it would ban all immigration from 50 Commonwealth countries, almost everywhere that is not majority white, excepting Japan and Singapore, and outbid Reform on remigration too.</p>

<p>Goodwin’s politics shifted dramatically after the EU referendum in 2016.  His referendum night prediction – at an LSE event as the polls closed – had been for a narrow Remain victory, though he was later to claim to have seen Brexit coming a long time before. </p>

<p>His journey rightwards has accelerated considerably in this decade too. He could not – today, be more scathing of the Conservative record – that the party should never be forgiven for its choices on immigration in particular.</p>

<p>Yet Goodwin remained a vocal champion of Boris Johnson while he was in power. “If Boris goes, the realignment goes”, he was tweeting into 2022, long after Johnson had designed his post-Brexit immigration system. He muted his criticism as he sought an inside track to influence – switching to building his profile in the online attention economy once that government fell.</p>

<p>Goodwin has shifted most dramatically to embrace Trumpism in its most extreme form. After the January 6 insurgency in 2021, he declared that he now saw “fascist” as an appropriate label for Trump. Five years on, Goodwin declared that the central challenge for Reform is “how a Reform government can look a lot more like Trump 2, rather than Trump 1?” </p>

<p>He has said of Trump’s norm-breaking second term: “It allowed us to see what a fightback looks like, what counter-cultural policies look like.” Yet the spectre of Trump’s chaos and cruelty could be Reform’s biggest electoral liabilities in Britain.<br><br>Will Goodwin win? He was the bookmakers’ favourite when his candidacy was declared. But the betting market momentum seems now to be with the Green Party favourites. </p>

<p>Gorton &amp; Denton is tougher terrain for Reform than Runcorn, won by only six votes last Spring. There are more Reform-friendly demographics in the Tameside council wards around Denton that make up a third of the constituency, but two-thirds of the constituency’s voters live in South Manchester, whose high level of ethnic diversity, students and graduates is less fertile ground.  </p>

<p>Reform’s opportunity is that both the Greens and Labour say they are the only hope of keeping Reform out, with little hard evidence about the state of the race on the ground. Goodwin’s path to Westminster probably depends on a fairly even three-way split in the vote. He will struggle to gain the seat if progressive voters do work out which rival candidate to coalesce around.</p>

<p>If he did win – and got to join the parliamentary group before Reform reached ten MPs – he may well end up driving the party’s home affairs policy agenda. Goodwin’s knowledge of social mobility would be an asset if Reform wanted to construct a substantive agenda on opportunity. His former colleagues in academia would be wary of this disillusioned ex-academic shaping the party’s higher education agenda, however.<br><br>Immigration is by far the top priority for Reform voters. Immigration levels have been falling fast – though Nigel Farage is in denial about this, telling the BBC last week that the net migration numbers were only down due to an “exodus” from the UK.</p>

<p>In fact, falling visa numbers make up 90% of the fall in net migration. Those falling numbers may see Reform may increasingly pivot to themes of integration – including Goodwin’s interest in exploring themes of the so-called “Islamification” of Britain and a ban on Muslim migrants.</p>

<p>Yet Farage faces a central dilemma in how far to echo the challenge from Rupert Lowe’s Restore Britain for mass deportations of legal migrants – which may appeal to his own core vote – and the need for a more balanced voice, when Reform’s shaky reputation on questions of racism and extremism with swing voters could put a ceiling on its support.<br><br>Defeat in Gorton &amp; Denton would be unlikely to end Goodwin’s parliamentary ambitions. His, campaign commitment to his Mancunian identity saw him declare “Manchester is in my blood” as he returned to his grandparents’ city – but it seems unlikely to see him veto opportunities to stand elsewhere by 2029, perhaps vaunting closer local connections in the East Midlands, West Midlands and the south of England. </p>

<p>But, first, Goodwin himself is on the ballot paper in Denton and Gorton. The outcome may illuminate the balance of risks and rewards for Reform, presenting itself as a potential government, in embracing the sharper edges of the online right.</p>

<p>“The President called me a traitor for fighting to release the Epstein files, yet the only one who has been against releasing the Epstein files is the man at the top. No one is letting this go.” — Marjorie Taylor Greene, former Republican congressional representative from Georgia, on X, February 10, 2026</p>

<p>“It is being covered up. Pam Bondi works directly for Trump… Do I believe that this administration is going to provide justice for anything in the Epstein files? No. Absolutely not. Because the president told me that his friends would get hurt.” — <em>Home of the Brave </em>podcast, February 9, 2026</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“I was a true believer. Bottom line. America First. But MAGA is – I think people are realising – it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people.” — <em>The Kim Iversen Show</em>, January 28, 2026</p>

<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene is losing her religion: the cult of MAGA and its reigning deity, Donald Trump. As outrage builds across the United States over what the former Republican Congresswoman from Georgia correctly calls the Epstein files “cover-up,” and as fury and disillusionment spread inside Republican and MAGA circles, her political stock has never been higher. </p>

<p>Greene is widely known as MTG, much as her initialled longtime political enemy, the New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is known as AOC. She is no longer merely a gun-toting dissenter cast out from the Make America Great Again fold by the Dear Leader, crying alone in the wilderness. </p>

<p>She is styling herself as a heretic prophet. Gathering adherents across what she labels the “political industrial complex”, Greene is making overtures to her former nemeses on the liberal left and centre – even, astonishingly, Hillary Clinton. And she appears to be relishing her new role.</p>

<p>Even Jon Ossoff, the Georgia senator and rising Democrat star, spoke approvingly of Greene at a recent political rally. “Welcome to the resistance,” he said.</p>

<p>Green’s spectacular rupture with Trump and the MAGA movement did not begin with a podcast confession or the latest redacted Epstein file dump. It began soon after Trump’s November 2024 election victory and was stoked by his apparent unwillingness to do what he had promised all throughout his campaign: to release the Epstein Files.</p>

<p>By late summer 2025 the issue came to a head with the passing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. In the autumn, Greene joined the Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna in backing a discharge petition to force a House floor vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act. That legislation required the attorney general to release government documents tied to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>

<p>The manoeuvre cut out both party leadership and the White House. Trump made clear he did not want it to proceed. According to Greene, he personally demanded she withdraw her support. When she refused, he erupted, screaming down her office phone with staff listening, calling her a “traitor,” warning that “his friends would get hurt” if the files came out.</p>

<p>There had already been simmering tensions between Greene and Trump, particularly over her attacks on Israel’s war in Gaza, on Trump’s taste for foreign entanglements and on healthcare affordability. But suddenly it morphed into open war.</p>

<p>In November Greene stood outside the Capitol, flanked by Epstein survivors, to recount her own tale of being abused and labelled traitorous by the commander-in-chief. She framed the fight as existential. “This has been one of the most destructive things to MAGA,” she said. “Watching the man that we supported early on, three elections… watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.”</p>

<p>On November 21, Greene announced she would resign from Congress rather than face a Trump-backed primary challenge. In the weeks before and after that announcement, she and her allies say she received escalating death threats, amplified by Trump’s denunciations branding her a traitor. The September assassination of far right podcaster and Turning Point activist Charlie Kirk, she later said, made her fear she might become “the next Charlie”.</p>

<p>On CBS’s 60 Minutes in December Greene started revealing behind the scenes details that clearly rankled Trump, including that fellow Republicans privately mock the president. She described him screaming at her during the final showdown over the Epstein petition and issued a mea culpa for her participation in “toxic politics” and for spreading QAnon conspiracist mumbo-jumbo. She insisted the problem was no longer Trump’s staff – it was Trump himself.</p>

<p>The next day Trump retaliated on Truth Social, claiming she had been calling him obsessively like a spurned lover and he hadn’t had time to call her back. </p>

<p>“The only reason Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown (Green turns Brown under stress!) went BAD is that she was JILTED by the President of the United States… Certainly not the first time she has been jilted!) Her ideas are, NOW, really BAD – She sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple!”</p>

<p>She was, Trump, said: “lunatic,” “neurotic,” “whacky” and a “stone-cold liberal.”</p>

<p>Greene responded by embracing the conjugal metaphors. She was a “battered wife”, she said, and would no longer tolerate the abuse.</p>

<p>On January 7, two days after her final day in office, she appeared on The View, a TV show hosted by Trump hate figures like Whoopi Goldberg. The programme is now under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>“The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was the president calling me a traitor for standing with women who were raped when they were teenagers,” she told the panel. “One of MAGA’s big campaign pledges was to release the Epstein files.”</p>

<p>When Joy Behar asked if she would go back if he begged, Greene joked about the father of her three children, from whom she separated in 2022. “Who? My ex-husband? No, just kidding. Absolutely not, the way he treated me.”</p>

<p>The French journalist Sonia Dridi, Washington correspondent for LCI network, has covered the White House and Congress for a decade. Greene once publicly mocked her for her accent – in her view, MTG’s break-up with Trump is a watershed moment for MAGA, even if Trump’s base is not necessarily under threat.</p>

<p>“She was one of his earliest and most loyal supporters,” Dridi says. “I saw her arrive at the Capitol. I crossed paths with her right when she first came up the steps. She really entered politics for Trump – <em>because</em> of Trump.”</p>

<p>That is why the split between Greene and Trump carries so much weight. “So this public ‘divorce’ is extremely significant. She was one of his most devoted followers – faithful among the faithful.”</p>

<p>When Greene now says MAGA was a mendacious operation, it has a powerful impact. “There are going to be more and more disillusioned MAGA supporters,” says Dridi, “precisely because Greene is openly telling people that MAGA was a lie and trying to pull those disappointed voters into her camp.”</p>

<p>“The fuel for that disenchantment isn’t just fatigue with Trump’s focus on foreign issues – Greenland, Venezuela, possibly Iran. It’s the Epstein issue. More voters are asking more and more questions about Trump’s links to the affair – some are angry, some are confused – and Greene is speaking directly into that space.”</p>

<p>It’s a remarkable conversion. Greene once embodied the unquestioning faith in the dogmas of the Trump sect. She joined in with the cult of personality built around an infallible Dear Leader. She enthusiastically adopted the posture of the true apostle, the good Christian soldier who proselytised on behalf of her leader.</p>

<p>At a 2024 campaign rally, Greene made the ultimate MAGA statement of belief: “The Democrats and the fake news media want to constantly talk about ‘President Trump is a convicted felon’. Well, you want to know something? The man that I worship is also a convicted felon. And he was murdered on a Roman cross.”</p>

<p>But then came Gaza, soaring healthcare costs, and Epstein. On The Kim Iversen Show she compared Trump to a “giant swamp creature.” The mask, she said, had come off.</p>

<p>“Like I could care less about Iran. I don’t care about Israel. I don’t care about Ukraine and Russia and China. I don’t care about Venezuela. I don’t care about any of them. I care about America. I care about our problems. I care about the fact that my kids, who are Gen Z, will never be able to afford life. </p>

<p>“That whole generation, they probably won’t be able to buy a house. They can’t afford health insurance. They can’t afford car insurance. Most of their jobs are going to be replaced by AI. That’s the stuff I care about. But after we won the election in 2024, a few months in and MAGA started turning into MIGA [Make Israel Great Again].”</p>

<p>“It started turning into whatever Donald Trump – whatever <em>country</em> – Donald Trump said it was about.”</p>

<p>Greene was born in 1974 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Raised Catholic, she later described becoming a born-again evangelical Christian as a defining transformation. It aligned her worldview with militant Christian nationalism.</p>

<p>Before politics she ran CrossFit gyms, developing a persona based around physical aggression, discipline and combativeness. She benefited from family wealth tied to Taylor Commercial, in which she had significant shareholdings, despite presenting herself as an anti-elite insurgent.</p>

<p>Since entering Congress in 2020, she compiled one of the most extreme records of any modern US lawmaker, promoting the QAnon and also the Pizzagate conspiracy which alleged the existence of a satanic pedophile network allegedly led by Democrats. She endorsed the execution of political opponents, including Nancy Pelosi. She warned of a “price of blood” if Trump was not reelected.</p>

</figure>

<p>In September 2020 Greene posted an image of herself carrying a gun beside the three prominent Democratic congresswomen known as “The Squad”, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, writing: “We need strong conservative Christians to go on the offense.” Facebook removed it.</p>

<p>She amplified antisemitic conspiracy theories, including that the California wildfires had been caused by a Rothschild-linked “Jewish space laser.” She harassed Parkland survivor David Hogg, demeaning him as “trained like a dog.” She suggested that school shootings were staged.</p>

<p>Before and after the Capitol riots of January 6, 2021, Greene was one of the loudest congressional amplifiers of the lie that the 2020 election was “stolen”. In the weeks before the November 2020 election, she warned supporters that “the only way you get your freedoms back is it’s earned with the price of blood.” </p>

<p>On January 6 itself, she voted to object to certifying Joe Biden’s victory. In the aftermath, she continued to question the legitimacy of the result, suggested without evidence that antifa or Black Lives Matter activists may have been involved in the breach, and dismissed the House select committee investigating the riot as a partisan “witch hunt.” She also voted against awarding Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol police officers who defended the building that day. </p>

<p>In February 2021, the Democratic-controlled House stripped Greene of all her committee assignments in a bipartisan vote after past statements surfaced endorsing violence against Democrats and embracing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Greene was permanently banned from Twitter in January 2022 for Covid misinformation. She flouted mask mandates and was fined repeatedly.</p>

<p>Even now, amid her anti-Trump turn, the conspiratorial reflex remains. In the wake of the Epstein files drop, she reposted a suggestion that the sex trafficker was alive and “playing Fortnite in Israel”. She continues to rehash the rigged election theories about 2020.</p>

<p>The political scientist Norman Ornstein, emeritus fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is not convinced by the conversion narrative. He sees something more tactical and limited.</p>

<p>“Most anti-Trumpists are not embracing Greene,” Ornstein told me. Instead, he saud, they are “trying to use her anti-Trump message, which reaches a lot of Trump supporters, as an asset in challenging his lies and at least creating some uncertainty among Trumpists.”</p>

<p>“Of course, she has a following within the cult,” he adds. “But her influence is likely to wane now that she is out of office, and a bid for the GOP nomination is not likely to go anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Will she face death threats and other attempts to silence her, coming from the Trump orbit? And if so, will it change her in any way? Will she drop some of her conspiracy theories and become more ‘mainstream’? I doubt that very much. So her voice in opposition is welcome, but not a gamechanger.”</p>

<p>Mike Rothschild, author of <em>Jewish Space Lasers: The Rothschilds and 200 Years of Conspiracy Theories</em>, and a writer for Conspiracy Watch Global, is even more unsentimental.</p>

<p>“I’ve generally felt about MTG that she’s positioning herself to take over the mantle of leadership in the GOP,” he says, “but only once the fallout from Trump clears.”</p>

<p>“She can steer clear of politics for a year and a half, then re-emerge in mid-2027 as the sane and family-focused alternative to JD Vance. Or maybe she just doesn’t want to get involved politically in anything anymore and just live a normal life. She could probably build a big audience as a podcaster, but her book <em>MTG</em> was a complete bomb.”</p>

<p>“She’s still a conspiracy theorist, and still supports a lot of what Trump did. There’s a niche for her in the anti-Epstein, pro-child, mostly pro-Trump sphere – it’s just a question of whether she grabs it.”</p>

<p>A survey of Greene’s frequent outings on X and podcast ramblings prove that she is still hammering her conspiracist themes of foreign government control, and continuing with her obsessive antipathy for Israel, a professed liking for Russia and her repetition of January 6 lies. </p>

<p>“Every Hollywood movie you watch, who are the bad guys? Russia,” she told Kim Iversen in January. “For so long, Russia’s the bad guys and the villain is Russian and we’re supposed to be hating Russians, but yet Russia hasn’t done anything to me. I don’t feel offended or hurt by Russia. As a matter of fact, I don’t even think about Russia. I’m pretty impressed they’re such a Christian country.”</p>

<p>​​Joni Askola, a Finnish geopolitical analyst and <em>Kyiv Post </em>writer is wary of being “fooled by Marjorie Taylor Greene turning on Trump”.</p>

<p>“She is still a pro-Russian traitor and a conspiracy theorist,” he says. “She isn’t finding a conscience, she is just fighting for control of the grift. Do not rehabilitate these horrible people. They deserve zero support.”</p>

<p>And then there is JD Vance.</p>

<p>In January in the midst of her ongoing battle with Trump, Greene conspicuously publicly praised the Vance, defending him against the Muslim-hating conspiracist and Trump favourite Laura Loomer. The two have form. Back in 2023, Greene commented that Loomer “is a bitch” who “says she is spreading all this truth, but… she’s just spreading her legs”.</p>

<p>Appearing on Tucker Carlson’s show in October, Greene was asked how Loomer came to be a Pentagon adviser. “This is a woman that can’t even legally buy a gun because she had such serious mental problems,” she said. “Who listens to a person like that? No one should!”.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2025 and Greene said: “Laura Loomer is viscously [sic] attacking @JDVance for delivering a message to Pro-Life Christians at the March for Life. Her attacks say far more about her than anything about the Vice President, who is a married father of 3 beautiful children with his wife, Usha, expecting their 4th child. </p>

<p>“As a Pro-Life Christian myself, I am thankful our Vice President’s stand for the innocent lives of unborn children and delivering a message about the abundance of love, joy, and fulfillment of being a parent.”</p>

<p>This was more than a gushing profession of devotion to Vance. It read like a pointed sketch of post-POTUS MAGA: Trumpism without Trump. </p>

<p>And then in mid-February, she made perhaps her strongest statement on X so far. “All of you MAGA influencers and the rest mocking the seriousness of women who were trafficked and raped as teenagers and young women look like cult fools,” she told her 5.3 million followers. “Good luck trying to get women to vote for Republicans in the midterms you insensitive clowns.”</p>

<p>It was yet another sign that MTG has exited the “cult” and turned her back on the fountainhead. But even so, she has not renounced the theology. If anything, she appears to be positioning herself to shape, or perhaps even lead, whatever comes after it.</p>

<p>Conservative peer Daniel Hannan is a man nostalgic for the way things used to be – all the more so if they happen to be things he could not possibly remember.</p>

<p>Last year, the ‘Brain of Brexit’ wrote a misty-eyed column for the website <em>Conservative Home</em>, recalling his memories of that day in May 1979 when Margaret Thatcher was first elected prime minister. It ended, he said, “the sense of despair that hung about the country like a cold mist in the late 1970s”.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Hannan remembered: “I recall being shocked at the way adults talked. Britain was finished, they were forever telling me. Things were going to the dogs. It was time to emigrate. Remarkably similar to how people talk now, in fact.</p>

<p>“A three-day week, a Conservative government setting prices and incomes, trade union barons being better-known household names than cabinet ministers, double-digit inflation, 83 per cent income tax, power cuts, strikes. It did indeed feel as if Britain was finished.”</p>

<p>Remarkable memories – and all the more so since, in May 1979, Hannan was not only seven years old but living in Peru. How precocious to be learning the name of trade union barons from a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo at such a tender age!</p>

<p>Now Hannan is once more heading down false memory lane, this time bemoaning the decision by Harold Wilson’s government to introduce decimalisation of UK’s currency in 1967, a move which took effect in February 1971. </p>

<p>Posting a picture on, inevitably, X of the coins folk wrestled with prior to the change, Lord Hannan wrote: “Fifty-five years ago #OTD we sundered ourselves from our fathers, replacing our handsome and ancient coinage with a decimal system.” His post garnered hundreds of comments from those still mourning the change, including “I’d bring it back in a heartbeat”, “A lovely sound the made too, clinking in your pocket as you headed for the corner shop to buy some penny chews” and “This damaged my life and many others of my generation”.</p>

<p>It is, however, a trifle odd that Hannan is so nostalgic for shillings, florins and thrupenny bits, given that he was born in September 1971, six months after decimalisation, and didn’t move to Britain until he was sent to boarding school in the Cotswolds at the age of eight, meaning that he never actually used the pre-decimal currency. Still, now he’s got the Brexit he fought so hard for, a man needs a new campaign to pursue!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Nigel Farage has named his new spokespeople as he seeks to rid his party of its one-man band tag. How long until they all fall out?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>As he tries to rid Reform of the “one-man club” tag, Nigel Farage has announced his shadow cabinet. But you can’t really call it that – Reform is still only the fifth largest party by size in the Commons, if you count independents, and would need 17 more MPs to shadow everyone in Keir Starmer’s top team.</p>

<p>But what a squad Nigel has assembled! Farage’s new Treasury spokesperson – he’s not the shadow chancellor, BBC – is Robert Jenrick, who only joined the party a month ago and has already leapfrogged the two men who had been scrapping it out for the role for much of the past 18 months or so.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Deputy leader Richard Tice, when asked if he wanted to become chancellor last year, told the BBC: “I’m not going to assume anything, but …”. It’s a good job he didn’t: despite being leader of the party for the three years in which Farage couldn’t be bothered – and at one point being personally responsible for about 80% of its funding – Tice’s reward is for the potential chancellorship to slip through his fingers to a man who was a member of an entirely different party just four weeks ago.</p>

<p>Similarly, Zia Yusuf also had designs on No 11, telling <em>POLITICO</em> last year that “chancellor is obviously a very interesting and important position”. His loss to Jenrick is even more personal: Yusuf is said to have been the most lukewarm on Jenrick’s defection of Farage’s inner circle after Jenrick accused him of “bullshit” last year. </p>

<p>Yusuf had claimed that a member of his team “accidentally pressed like” on an antisemitic X post attacking Jenrick’s wife, who is Jewish. Jenrick had also dubbed him ‘Zia Useless’. No chances of any big bust-ups here, then!</p>

<p>Tice’s consolation is a new role combining business, trade and energy policy, which at least gives him the opportunity to use his hilarious catchphrase “net stupid zero”, which has so fully inserted itself in the greater public consciousness, even more. </p>

<p>And he has experience in the area, though: while Tice calls renewable power a “massive con” in public, last year it emerged a farm and horse racing business he owned had installed solar panels and battery storage. In addition, he co-owns Quidnet Reid Ltd, a business operating industrial estates across the country. In its accounts for 2022, the company celebrated installing solar on three sites, noting that “these initiatives will save hundreds of tonnes of CO2 every year and help our occupiers with lower electricity bills… as well as provide an attractive return to shareholders”.</p>

<p>Yusuf has been handed the Home Office brief, which means he may need to rethink which end of Parliament he wants to aim for. Reform-watchers had widely expected Yusuf to be handed a peerage if Farage becomes PM, rather than contest a seat for the Commons. But the last home secretary to do the job from the Lords was Constantine Phipps, the 1st Marquess of Normanby, in 1841: surely a party which has trumpeted the need for democracy so loudly in the past couple of days wouldn’t follow suit?</p>

<p>Finally, with Farage perhaps remembering that women are a thing, he appointed another recent defector from the Tories, Suella Braverman, as his education and equalities spokesperson. The latter is a brief she showed her suitability for with an article for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> last year headlined “I will never be truly English: here is why”  in which she argued that Englishness “must be rooted in ancestry, heritage, and, yes, ethnicity – not just residence or fluency”.</p>

<p>It does mean that just four of Farage’s MPs don’t have cabinet roles to shadow – Danny Kruger is leading the party’s preparations for government, Lee Anderson is chief whip and Andrew Rosindell is mad. The fourth, Sarah Pochin, might feel hardest done by, having all but announced in a <em>Times</em> interview last year that she would be justice secretary under a Farage government – but perhaps the leader’s saving that for the inevitable spring reshuffle once the current crop all fall out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The costs are huge, the interest repayments on student loans are crushing and the jobs market is alarmingly weak. And yet – there are still very good reasons to go to Uni]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“A graduate generation trapped and betrayed”. “The great graduate job drought”. “Will student loans be the next mis-selling scandal?” “700k graduates on benefits”. These are just a few of the many scary newspaper headlines published in the past month or two that, taken together, prompt the question: is university worth it any more?</p>

<p>What’s for certain is that the calculation has changed almost beyond recognition in the past two decades. It used to be a no-brainer. You got decent A levels. You went to university, preferably a long way from home. You had three enjoyable years, largely at the taxpayer’s expense. And you looked forward to a career where it was reasonable to expect that your pay would be significantly higher than it would have been without your degree.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The change began in the Blair years and accelerated dramatically during the long period of Conservative government. Over that time, tuition fees in England largely replaced state funding for university teaching and maintenance grants were replaced by loans, funded in both cases by the government-subsidised student loans scheme. </p>

<p>Taking both sets of support together the result was that students graduating in England in 2024 had on average outstanding loans of around £53,000 – more than double the level in 2014-15, before maintenance grants were removed. The repayment terms will be determined by how much money they make each year, and will for many students be spread out over most of their working lives.</p>

<p>This has had two major effects on the way students approach their university choices. One has been a very big switch in applications to courses that might lead to well-paid jobs like medicine or business and away from the humanities, the aim being to ease the repayment burden. </p>

<p>The other has been a much heavier demand for places in institutions that are thought to be in favour with employers – some, though not all, of the research-intensive Russell Group, or other universities with a strong record in areas like engineering.</p>

<p>In this changed environment, going to university is no longer the default option for students with the necessary qualifications, and the choice requires a lot more research and thought than ever before. Here are the eight questions that need to be addressed before making a decision.</p>

<p><strong>Do you aspire to a job that requires a degree?</strong> </p>

<p>Medicine is an obvious example but there are others, for example in areas of finance, engineering or teaching. Such careers can be well paid, making loan repayments less onerous.</p>

<p><strong>Are you enthusiastic enough about a particular subject to commit to studying it hard for three years? </strong></p>

<p>It’s become a lot easier to get into prestigious universities by applying for the less popular courses. But that can’t be a sensible way of making such a big decision. Tuition fees now amount to £9,535 a year, and in future are set to rise at a pace to offset inflation. You must be studying a subject that you find stimulating and interesting to justify that kind of investment. All the evidence shows that the choice of the course is at least as important as the choice of the university as a pathway to future success.</p>

<p><strong>Will your degree bring you economic benefit?</strong> </p>

<p>The answer is: it depends. Taken as a whole, graduates still earn significantly more than non-graduates over their working lives, although the size of that premium has been shrinking in recent years with the rapid growth of the graduate population. </p>

<p>But the average figure hides a wide range of potential outcomes. On one analysis, you were pretty well certain of getting a positive net return on your undergraduate degree in England if you studied medicine, computing or economics. By contrast, only a minority of male students gained economically from a degree in the creative arts.</p>

<p>This is where you need to understand how student loans in England work. If you started university in 2023 or later, you will come into what’s called Plan 5 of the repayment scheme. Under this, payments start once you earn more than £25,000 a year, and you pay 9% of your income above that threshold. Interest starts accruing from the day you start taking out a loan and is set every year on the basis of the retail price index of inflation. This year, that runs at 3.2%.</p>

<p>For reference, the median gross annual earnings for full-time employees in the UK last year were just over £39,000. If your earnings were much less than this, say £30,000, then under Plan Five your annual repayment would only amount to around £450 whereas accrued interest on a £50,000 loan would add roughly about £1,600 to your outstanding debt. On that basis, you would never pay off the loan, and under the Plan 5 scheme it would be cancelled after 40 years.</p>

<p>Things start to get much more uncomfortable for what you might call middle-income earners: somewhere between the median and, say, £55,000 a year. Your annual repayment would be much higher, but still not enough to clear the outstanding debt. So you would be paying back what amounts to a sizeable chunk of your income almost until retirement was in sight.</p>

<p>Once you get above that earnings figure the picture starts to look very different. Annual repayments are high, but the debt is paid off more quickly so the interest costs don’t roll up.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that for high earners, the student loan scheme is a reasonably helpful form of subsidised debt. For low earners, it’s the equivalent of a graduate tax. For people in the middle, it can be a heavy burden.</p>

<p>So that’s why the choice of course matters so much to so many students. It’s one reason why the number of undergraduates studying business and management in the UK had risen last year to 587,000, up by four-fifths since 2014-15. And it explains the steady decline in the take-up of humanities over the same period. </p>

<p>It’s the sad but inevitable result of ham-fisted government policy.</p>

<p><strong>Which university offers you the best chance of a good career? </strong></p>

<p>Once you’ve decided on the course, the next step is to choose where to study it. This isn’t just a question of going to the most prestigious institution: the best-ranked teaching in a particular course is not always to be found in the grandest universities. Employers use universities as a filtering tool in recruitment: their views matter and can easily be tracked online.</p>

<p>A point to consider is that according to the Office for Students 45% of English higher education providers will be losing money this year unless they take mitigating action. Some are already laying off large numbers of faculty members. Better to go to somewhere that’s thriving rather than somewhere that isn’t.</p>

<p>You can judge the way students are working all this out by looking at the way student numbers are changing in particular institutions. Overall acceptances this year rose by 2%. The Russell Group had a 9% increase, but this was heavily concentrated in half a dozen universities – UCL, York, Queen Mary, Durham, Warwick and Exeter, all of which had increases of 20% or more. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, places like Bath Spa and Wolverhampton saw big increases. But several other less-favoured institutions registered steep declines in acceptance rates.</p>

<p><strong>How will you pay for your living expenses? </strong></p>

<p>The best answer is to have well-off parents. But if they are not available, you have to turn to student maintenance loans. Under the government scheme, most students can borrow an amount each year which is based on their family household income, whether they live at home, and whether they study in expensive London. For someone living away from home and at a university outside London, the maximum entitlement this year is just short of £11,000.</p>

<p>In real terms, this figure has declined significantly in the past decade, partly because of higher-than-expected inflation and partly because the government has frozen the threshold for household incomes that determines how much can be borrowed. </p>

<p>This explains why large numbers of students now live at home, rather than study in distant cities, and why so many students have had to take up part-time jobs in order to make ends meet. A recent analysis by the Higher Education Policy Institute found that, in a study of four universities, two-thirds of students were working part time to cover their living costs, and on average were doing 50-hour weeks when study and travel time were also taken into account.</p>

<p>That’s a long way from Brideshead Revisited.</p>

<p>The government has promised to restore maintenance grants to students from disadvantaged backgrounds in as yet unnamed priority subjects. But these are unlikely to be on a scale to be game changers.</p>

<p><strong>What if you really want to study a subject that seems unlikely to lead to a well-paid job? </strong></p>

<p>Go for it – but do so with your eyes open. Get to understand the fine detail of the loan scheme. Do all the homework you possibly can.</p>

<p>Where you want to live after university will make a difference: life is a lot cheaper outside London. And no-one – least of all the government – knows where the jobs of the future lie. AI firms are hiring philosophers to help them grapple with the ethical issues thrown up by their technology. Software companies need anthropologists to understand how their kit might be used. We’ll always need poets.</p>

<p><strong>What are the realistic alternatives to a university degree? </strong></p>

<p>There are quite a few, but they are fragmented and depend in some measure on where you live. Higher and degree-level apprenticeships are an attractive option for people who want practical paid-for learning, but they are not available in huge numbers. Some of the big accounting firms are taking on school leavers and teaching them the tools of the profession. More employers are saying that what matters to them is attitude, rather than degree qualifications.</p>

<p>But it can be a risky path. Unemployment rates are lower for graduates. According to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, women without a degree find it harder to get a well-paid job than do men. And people from disadvantaged backgrounds find it much harder to get a good income if they don’t have a degree.</p>

<p><strong>Will AI destroy the value of your degree? </strong></p>

<p>That’s been a popular newspaper scare story in recent months as early-career employment has been squeezed at the same time as AI has taken off. In fact, this correlation looks dodgy: the pressure is more likely to have come from interest rate changes and economic uncertainty than from ChatGPT. </p>

<p>Consultancy firms have a happy time forecasting massive disruption in the labour market, but the reality is that no one knows when, whether, or how AI will have a real impact. The best bet surely is to assume that in a knowledge-intensive society an ability to think critically will be more important, not less.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that even in today’s very different environment, the student experience is about much more than building economic value. It’s also a time for developing intellectual and social capital, for learning new ideas and making new friends. Despite all the gloomy headlines, few graduates regret going to university –  around 8% in a recent survey. And far fewer students drop out of their course in the UK than is the case in other developed countries.</p>

<p>So yes. Provided you go in with your eyes open and understand that the university world has changed dramatically in recent decades: provided you choose the right course in the right university: provided you recognise that one way or another you are going to have to pay for most of the benefits of your education – then university is still well worth it.</p>

<p>Here’s something smart someone once said: “Every film is political. Most political of all are those that pretend not to be: ‘entertainment’ movies. They are the most political films there are because they dismiss the possibility of change. In every frame, they tell you everything’s fine the way it is. They are a continual advertisement for things as they are.”</p>

<p>Here’s the same fellow some time later, having been comped a five-star hotel suite and some nice nosh: “We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics,” he said. “But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.” </p>

<p>Both quotes are from Wim Wenders, the head of jury at this year’s Berlinale film festival. He sailed into a sea of political controversy last Thursday with the nonchalance of the captain of the Titanic. </p>

<p>Who could’ve known that there would be a question about Gaza in the festival’s opening press conference, attended by members of the judging panel? Well, anyone awake in the last two years. </p>

<p>In 2024, two of the filmmakers behind West Bank documentary <em>No Other Land</em> gave a short speech about Israel’s actions in the occupied territories here. Their behaviour was subsequently described by a Bundestag resolution as one of the “biggest antisemitism scandals of recent years.” Then last year, the police opened investigations against attendees of the festival when the phrase “from the river to the sea” was used publicly, an investigation the festival cooperated with. </p>

<p>This year’s conflict began when a German journalist asked the jury why they thought the festival had not issued a statement of solidarity with the Palestinian people, in sharp contrast to its full-throated support of Ukraine and Ukrainian filmmakers following the Russian invasion and later, its vocal support of protesters in Iran. </p>

<p>Polish producer and jury member Ewa Puszczyńska replied: ”There are many wars where genocide is committed, and we do not talk about them… so this is a complicated question and it’s a bit of an unfair question.” It’s mindboggling that the producer of The Zone of Interest should spread such misinformation. </p>

<p>There are no other conflicts in progress in which genocide is currently taking place, except for Gaza. Genocide Watch says it may potentially be taking place in Sudan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Confoand Mynamar, but Gaza is the one place where multiple organisations recognise it as an ongoing situation. And it’s the only place where support by Germany, the USA and other European powers have, to some degree, facilitated Israel’s actions. </p>

<p>Due to a technical issue, the live feed of the press conference cut out just as the German journalist asked his question. A coincidence, surely.</p>

<p>If they wanted to keep politics out of the Berlinale, they could not have been more cackhanded. The headlines around the world have been about nothing else, with nary a film mentioned. They’ve become like puritans shouting so graphically about how we shouldn’t have sex that we all end up horny. Writer Arundhati Roy pulled out of the festival she’d been due to attend, presenting a restored version of her 1989 film<em> In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones</em>, saying: “To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping.” </p>

<p>And now every star and director at the festival is being asked about politics at every press conference and on the red carpet. To the point that we got a statement of quite some length  from artist director Tricia Tuttle – call it the Tuttle rebuttal – telling us there’s nothing to really talk about and really can’t we just stop talking about politics and politics and politics. Be good, watch the films as they change the world one heart at a time. </p>

<p>I feel her pain. Rupert Grint hasn’t really got an answer for how to fight fascism, or that Neil Patrick Harris is “always interested in doing things that are apolitical.” As Michael Jordan says, “Republicans buy sneakers too.” </p>

<p>This is the thing. The Berlinale is sponsored by Armani Beauty and TikTok, Mastercard and the Cupra automotive brand. For all the films might attack notions of patriarchy, colonialism, hierarchy, and patriarchy, we still have glamour and the star system, VIPs and deference. </p>

<p>The social realist star who convinced you so much in the drama about the immigrant living hand to mouth will be unrecognisable wearing haute couture for the gala premiere on the red carpet. There is a genuine tension between power and art; and when artists themselves become seduced by the trappings their rationalisations begin to appeal more to the hearts rather than the brains; they talk about empathy rather than solidarity; our truths, rather than the actual truth.</p>

<p>Let me repurpose the Wim Wenders quote I began with: “Every film [festival] is political. Most political of all are those that pretend not to be… They are a continual advertisement for things as they are.”</p>

<p>As I was writing this on the morning of Sunday, February 15, 11 people in Gaza were killed by Israeli airstrikes.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Berlinale runs until February 22. John Bleasdale’s novel Connery, about the life of Sean Connery, is published by Plumeria</strong></em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[A new documentary reminds us of what a consummate politician he was - and how much his achievements are tarnished by Iraq]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>More than 18 years have passed since Tony Blair stepped down as the UK’s prime minister, but the man himself still seems to live large in British political life. </p>

<p>The Labour right is still endlessly described as “Blairite”, particularly by its enemies. The Tony Blair Institute’s policy recommendations – on oil drilling, ID cards, and AI – drop weekly, with wide coverage. Blair himself regularly pops up on the world stage, most recently lobbying with mixed success to run Trump’s peace committee on Gaza.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>That makes the prospect of watching a four-hour documentary – split into three parts across Channel 4 this week – on Blair and the Blair era feels like something of an ambivalent prospect. Do I really need to reflect on Tony Blair, when his presence still feels close to all-encompassing?</p>

<p>To his credit, filmmaker Michael Waldman does everything he can to provide a compelling answer to that question. He has extensive access to almost every key figure from around Blair’s rise and his premiership. Blair himself is present, as are most of his key aides – including, of course, <em>The New World’s</em> own Alastair Campbell – and even his children. Interviews with some of the Sedgefield Labour members who selected Blair as their candidate in 1983 are entertaining and enlightening.</p>

<p>Only Gordon Brown, a looming figure throughout the story, is notable by his absence as an interviewee. The documentary is, though, having to reckon with the renewed recent disgrace of Peter Mandelson, who it extensively interviewed. Reports suggest the documentary is being re-cut to minimise Mandelson’s contributions, but it is not clear whether the previews watched by <em>The New World</em> were the old or the new versions. Even Blairite scandals extend into the present day.</p>

<p>The early effect of the documentary is one that Blair himself will surely appreciate. It is hard to get all that far into the first of the three parts without being struck by just how talented a politician Tony Blair was, and is. His natural and easy style in archive footage is unmatched by anyone in frontline politics today. </p>

<p>And while Waldman comes across as a talented and patient interviewer, when Blair chooses to do his ‘I’m levelling with you here’ trick, he almost effortlessly gains the upper hand in their exchanges. Tony Blair is good at this, and boy does he know it.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the freight train we all knew was heading our way arrives. The second of the three episodes is about the Iraq war, which is probably necessary given the terrible consequences of that conflict are still playing out to this day.</p>

<p>But everyone involved has made up their mind on this issue. Blair is never going to say he got this wrong. He seems genuinely convinced that he <em>didn’t</em> get it wrong. </p>

<p>The story is well told, but awfully familiar, except for a lively scene in which Bill Clinton – who seems determined not to cause trouble for his friend – desperately tries to avoid saying that he wouldn’t have invaded Iraq were he in Blair’s place, never quite saying the words but with his body language speaking volumes.</p>

<p>A brisker final volume on Blair’s downfall also does a cursory scan of Blair’s career after frontline politics, and his desperate desire to build a legacy that transcends Iraq – his time as the “Quad’s” Middle East peace envoy, his hopes that the Tony Blair Institute will outlive Tony Blair, and his latest attempts to inveigle himself with Trump on Gaza.</p>

<p>As ever with Blair, it is the desire for a legacy that seems most likely to squander it. Liz Truss might be the most obvious post-prime ministerial flameout, but there is an argument that Blair’s meltdown is lower-key but more consequential. He has raised hundreds of millions from autocracies and pro-Trump billionaires. </p>

<p>His think tank has funding others could only dream of, but precious little credibility or creativity for that budget. Blair himself comes across as almost desperate to still be on the world stage – described in the documentary by one observer as “a statesman without a state”.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the documentaries will raise an eyebrow or two but change no-one’s mind, and there are worse sins television can commit than that. If there is a standout performer, it is surely Cherie Blair, a tour de force whenever she is on screen, whether it is archly denying being a Lady Macbeth figure or delicately suggesting Blair might have given Brown the impression he’d stand down without ever saying it.</p>

<p>Her most cryptic remark, though, comes right at the end of the documentary. “He is an amazing politician,” she says, after a pause, when asked about her husband’s flaws. “As a husband and as a human being, that’s a different matter. But that’s really between me and him.”</p>

<p>Now, whatever could <em>that</em> mean?</p>

<p><em><strong>The Tony Blair Story is screened on Channel 4 on February 17-19, and is streaming from February 18 on Channel4.com</strong></em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[The BBC documentary series shows that when the police fail, survivors become the last line of defence]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“That’s how we break his power over us, by being together,” declares Shannon, one of four victims of Aaron Swan who detail his crimes in <em>Lover, Liar, Predator</em>. Among their disturbing stories of coercive control, it’s a hard but hopeful moment.</p>

<p>Shannon is not alone. In the largest ever survey of rape and sexual assault survivors by Operation Soteria, set up to change the way the police investigate sexual offences, 88% of respondents of the survey prioritised the prevention of future harm. Women aren’t reporting to protect themselves, they are reporting to protect other women from the horrors that they have been subjected to. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p><em>Lover, Liar, Predator</em>, now streaming on iPlayer, is another shocking portrait of an abuser. It shows the access Aaron Swan had to vulnerable women as well as how hard the system makes it to stop a known, obvious and present threat. It should be shown in school Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) classes, along with workshops on what coercive control looks like – the love-bombing, the isolating aggression. We need to equip young women with the tools to recognise dangerous behaviours and extract themselves from those situations. </p>

<p>Natalie meets Aaron at the age of 17, escaping from an intensely religious background. We see her away from home for the first time, a goofy, happy kid. We then learn how that light was quickly extinguished by Swan coercing her into sex, impregnating her, marrying her and subjecting her to unwanted acts of sexual violence that she felt she had no right to object to. While doing this, Aaron constantly tells her she is worthless, that he is still in love with his ex and that she is lucky to have him. </p>

<p>Natalie goes into premature labour with her second child after violently being raped by her then-husband. She later recounts how she reported the crime to police while sitting next to her baby’s incubator, clear that the rape induced her labour. Watching Natalie’s interviews, I can’t help but think of the Epstein survivors whose stories are currently being used for political fodder while the world continues to ignore the actual victims who have not been believed for 15 years. </p>

<p><em>Lover, Liar, Predator’s </em>rolling timeline shows how Swan moved between victims. After Natalie reports Swan, he goes on the prowl via Facebook in Scarborough and happens upon Jenni, a 16-year-old living with her mum and sister. </p>

<p>Swan was already on the sex offenders list, but was nonetheless able to coerce Jenni away from her family and isolate her to move in with him in Jedburgh. Jenni’s mother alerted police and social services, who said they were unable to stop Jenni from going with Swan, despite past indicators of abusive behaviour. Swan is even found to have child sex abuse images on his iPad, but after escaping a conviction for raping Natalie, he is not given a custodial sentence. Instead, he is placed on another sexual offenders registry and is banned from being alone with his child – yet Jenni is still not protected from him.</p>

<p>Nor are other women. On the night of his engagement, he rapes Jenni’s closest female friend and uses that event to further humiliate and isolate Jenni, claiming it was consensual. Jenni loses her best friend and her route for escape. </p>

<p>As the horror story continues, the surprising unsung hero is Swan’s sister, who intervenes to try to protect the women in her brother’s orbit. She involves police when her brother threatens to kill himself and Jenni and later responsible for Robyn, his latest victim, enrolling in a course about domestic violence and abusive and coercive behaviour. In a remarkable turn of events, the course that she recommends to the 18-year-old turns out to have been written and produced by Natalie. It helps Robyn to report Swan to the authorities. </p>

<p>It’s easier to see Aaron Swan as a monster or an anomaly, but actually his behaviour is the very normal cycle of a sexual predator. The programme invites us to celebrate the moral and collective victory of the four women who came together to take him down, but that is nearly impossible to do, when the policing and justice systems don’t track, combine or help monitor predatory men. And for the four survivors we know about, there are five times that number whose stories we will never hear. </p>

<p>It should not take four women 20 years of corroboration and violent sexual assaults for a single predator to face justice. Just as it shouldn’t take hundreds of women and millions of emails to believe the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein. I’m grateful to these women, but they shouldn’t have to do the work that policing and judicial systems fail to do. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[Claims an agency hired by a Labour think tank investigated a Sunday Times journalist are a tad troublesome for the paper's political editor]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>There is nothing journalists like more than reporting on themselves, so the <em>Sunday Times</em> must have felt like all their Christmases had come at once when it emerged a think tank linked to Keir Starmer’s leadership had hired lobbyists to investigate a reporter who had looked into its funding.</p>

<p>Labour Together, the Starmerite group once run by Morgan McSweeney, is said to have paid £36,000 to Apco, a US public affairs firm, to probe the “backgrounds and motivations” of hacks Gabriel Pogrund, the <em>Sunday Times</em>’s Whitehall editor, and Harry Yorke, its deputy political editor. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The pair had been behind a 2023 report that Labour Together had failed to declare £730,000 of donations between 2017 and 2020. The Electoral Commission found the group guilty of 20 breaches of campaign finance laws and issued a fine in 2021.</p>

<p>According to the paper, following up reporting by Peter Geoghegan and the <a href="https://democracyforsale.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Democracy For Sale Substack blog</a> as well as Scotland’s <em>The National</em> paper, Apco produced a 58-page report “including almost ten pages of deeply personal and false claims” about Pogrund in particular, and falsely suggesting that the journalists might be part of a Russian conspiracy or had relied on emails hacked by the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Nicknamed ‘Operation Cannon’, the report is said to have been prepared by Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former <em>Sunday Times</em> employee. Harper wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the <em>Sunday Times</em> story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.</p>

<p>“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he wrote.</p>

<p>That was enough for the paper to lead with the story at the weekend, as well as devote its main editorial to it, writing: “How revealing it is that Labour Together [employed] the kind of shadowy agents the left has (sometimes rightly) been swift to condemn. A fact well worth remembering the next time a Labour minister takes to the airwaves demanding yet another inquiry into the ethics and working practices of the British press. Hypocrisy doesn’t even begin to cover it.”</p>

<p>What it didn’t mention, however, is the rather awkward position this has put the <em>Sunday Times</em>’s political team in. For “shadowy agent” Harper is married to… Caroline Wheeler, the paper’s political editor and thus, technically, Pogrund and Yorke’s boss – a conflict of interest within its own newsroom the paper neglected to report. </p>

<p>The pair got hitched at Christmas 2023 at a Graceland chapel in Las Vegas with an Elvis impersonator in attendance. There’ll certainly be a little less conversation between them all in future!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[An article about the Winter Olympics on the paper's site looks suspiciously like the work of robots]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>‘It wasn’t done by AI, our writer is just very bad,’ is a curious explanation for a media organisation to have to give in response to concerns about one of their articles – but it seems to be the reason the <em>Guardian</em> has offered to explain a very oddly written piece about figure skating on its website.</p>

<p>Under the headline ‘Anatomy of an upset: how Ilia Malinin lost Olympic figure skating gold’, Bryan Armen Graham reports on the American’s surprise defeat in the Winter Olympics at the weekend, deploying many of the tropes often associated with articles written by large language model (LLM) AI programs such as ChatGPT.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Common AI tics such as ‘not X but X’, ‘this isn’t X, it’s…’ and ‘this wasn’t just…, it was…’ are littered throughout the article, along with others rarely used except by AI, such as an explanation ‘sitting inside’ something or someone ‘quietly’ winning Olympic titles. On X, the writer Ian Leslie showed how he had put the article through the online AI detector Pangram, which gave it a 100% chance of being generated by AI.</p>

<p>“What made Ilia Malinin’s Olympic defeat so shocking was not simply his years-long dominance entering Friday night,” the article read. “It was how completely the competition had tilted in his favor before he even stepped on the ice.</p>

<p>“What made the result feel even closer to inevitable was what happened around him.”</p>

<p>The <em>Guardian</em> has denied that AI was used in writing the piece, saying: “Bryan is an exemplary journalist, and this is the same style he’s used for 11 years writing for the <em>Guardian</em>, long before LLMs existed. The allegation is preposterous.”</p>

<p>But many on social media have shared previous pieces by the writer, showing a much more florid style than the robotic one published this weekend. Have the robot overlords finally taken charge at King’s Place?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The magazine claimed chants about Keir Starmer at English football matches were "omnipresent". Really?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“You can probably determine the emotional-political register of Britain through the songs that are sung at sporting events,” writes Clive Martin in this week’s <em>New Statesman</em>. “And right now, ‘Keir Starmer’s a wanker’ has become so omnipresent, so all-inviting, that even highly tribalised football fans have put aside their rivalries to sing it. </p>

<p>“Sky and ITV partially mute the ditty from their live sports broadcasts, trying to avoid transmitting political statements, but at this point, it’s barely a political statement at all. It is more like a display of mass casual bullying, a playground chant carried out on a national level.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Which it would be… were it true. Rats in a Sack watches an awful lot of domestic football, both in person and on TV and has never heard fans chant about the prime minister. One contact says he’s heard the “omnipresent” song only once in 40 matches attended this season, and that was by Millwall fan. Certainly it could be heard being sung by England supporters during the snoozefest World Cup qualifier against Andorra late last year, but that hardly makes it ubiquitous.</p>

<p>A Sky Sports source tells Rats how it’s not an issue they have ever heard of and points out that muting individual chants, even “partially”, would be all but technically impossible in a live broadcast (hence commentators often apologising “if our mics picked up any choice language”, “choice language” being a phrase used by football commentators and absolutely no-one else).</p>

<p>‘Keir Starmer’s a wanker’ has definitely been chanted at a sports event recently – it was heard at this year’s PDC World Darts Championship at London’s Alexandra Palace, to the extent that at one point during his quarter final against Gary Anderson, the then world number 20 Ryan ‘Heavy Metal’ Searle appeared to join in. </p>

<p>But that wasn’t football. Was Martin mixing up his tackles with his tungsten?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>‘The Slug and Lettuce’, wrote one wag on social media at the weekend as Liz Truss, who some readers may recall was briefly prime minister of the United Kingdom, posted a picture of herself with Donald Trump at his Florida golf club.</p>

<p>“Right about everything,” Truss captioned her picture, tagging in the president’s handle. Trump, meanwhile, adopted the same rictus grin and half-hearted thumbs-up he does for all his fan pics, rather suggesting he had no idea who the former PM was. Lucky man.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Truss is increasingly seeking to align herself with Trump and the wider MAGA movement as she tries to relaunch herself as a hard right podcaster and influencer. She endorsed him before the 2024 election and travelled to Washington before his inauguration in a red ‘Make America Great Again’ hat despite, awkwardly, not having been invited.</p>

<p>Last year, she was even reported to have suggested to US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent that Trump could take advantage of his Scottish heritage once he leaves the White House to take British citizenship and run for office in the UK, potentially even becoming prime minister.</p>

<p>Not that any of it is helping <em>The Liz Truss Show</em>, her YouTube show which continues to attract pathetically small figures, not least due to the fact that she struggles to attract any but the most obscure online right wingers to feature on it.</p>

<p>Recently, Truss pulled in just 1,000 views for her interview with James Taylor of the Heartland Institute, a US think tank which argues smoking is not harmful, and Lois Perry, who was leader of UKIP for less than a month in 2024. Two weeks ago, she recorded an episode called ‘Britain’s Corrupt Media Exposed’ with Dan Wootton, sacked by GB News after giggling over sexist comments, and Mike Graham, who left Talk over allegations of a racist social media post. Another recent ‘star’ guest, pulling in 1,300 views, was GB News host Will Kingston.</p>

<p>Couldn’t Truss have persuaded her ‘friend’ Trump to have guested? At least somebody might have watched that…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Backing Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe for his comments attacking immigrants last week, Reform leader Nigel Farage said that “one million people living in this country don’t speak any English at all”, which seems like a huge figure. But is it true?</p>

<p>No, is the answer to that (or <em>nie</em>, <em>nu</em> or <em>ਨਹੀਂ</em>, if you prefer). Farage cited the most recent census in 2021. But that showed that only 161,000 people – or 0.3 per cent of the population of England and Wales – could not speak English at all, not one million.</p>

<p>Some 880,000 people, 1.5 per cent of the population, reported that they could not speak English well (it is unclear if this includes Lee Anderson). Adding these two figures together, as Farage appears to have done, does get you to just over one million – but that is <em>not</em> the total number of people who do not speak English at all.</p>

<p>Still, facts appear to matter increasingly little to the hard right. Farage was backing Ratcliffe over his comments that immigrants were “colonising” Britain – comments the businessman justified by claiming that the UK population had increased by an incredible 12 million since 2020. In fact, that figure was just 2.7 million.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe’s rant came shortly after Manchester United started their Premier League game at West Ham with an XI including two Brazilians, two Portuguese, a Belgian, an Argentine, an Ivorian and a French-born Cameroon international.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Reform refugee has launched his new, even further right party with a bizarre video, a string of esoteric policies and some suspect backers]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>With the inevitability of night following day, former Reform MP Rupert Lowe has launched a new party – and it’s already attracting support from some of the worst people on the far right fringes of politics.</p>

<p>Lowe, the Great Yarmouth MP who fell out with Nigel Farage after describing Reform as “a protest party led by the Messiah”, has announced the creation of Restore Britain, a national party even further to the right than his previous one.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The launch was announced with a bonkers social video featuring images from Britain’s past, including red squirrels, the opening credits of <em>Dad’s Army</em>, World War II bomber planes, the theme music to <em>Grandstand</em> and, bizarrely, Test Card F, the BBC image of a girl playing noughts and crosses with a clown.</p>

<p>Were one of Restore Britain’s policies to be reinstating the test card it would be no more esoteric than those it has already announced. These include allowing anyone to kill burglars, abolishing HR departments in private firms, banning the trans pride flag, giving parents “the right to take their children out of school for a limited number of days per year without getting fined” and outlawing halal and kosher food as “in Britain, we treat our animals with care” (Lowe recently had his labrador shot dead by his gamekeeper).</p>

<p>Lowe has already won the support of Elon Musk, who posted on his X platform: “Join Rupert Lowe in Restore Britain, because he is the only one who will actually do it!”. Musk was once very supportive of Reform – while Farage has always liked having something to his right to make his own party look relatively mainstream, he might not appreciate it if some of Musk’s millions he once thought was coming his way ended up in Restore Britain’s coffers.</p>

<p>While welcoming Musk’s backing, though, Lowe may wish to downplay some of those who have already thrown their weight behind his start-up. Among those at his launch event in Great Yarmouth was Lucy White, a GB News contributor accused of racism last year after arguing that the House of Commons deputy speaker, Nusrat Ghani, should not be allowed in Parliament because she was born in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Other backers include Steve Laws, associated with the Patriotic Alternative group, who posted on X “RUPERT LOWE IS OUR LEADER”, and Callum Barker, a former Homeland activist best known for leading ani-migrant protests outside an Essex hotel. Sam Wilkes, an online conspiracy theorist who posts videos defending the legacy of Adolf Hitler under the alias Zoomer Historian, said “We’re with Lord Protector Lowe” and “Rupert Lowe is our Ian Smith” (a reference to the Rhodesian leader and not Harold Bishop from <em>Neighbours</em>, presumably).</p>

<p>“We have a bloody good chance of winning the next election,” said Lowe at his launch. It seems unlikely – but what with Restore Britain and Advance UK, the party set up by ex-Reform deputy leader Ben Habib after he too fell out with Farage, the Turquoise Tories will soon have more spin-offs than <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>It’s official… <em>Melania</em>, Amazon’s $75m hagiography of the US first lady, is not only a critical flop but, to no-one’s great surprise, a financial one too.</p>

<p>The universally panned film took $10.97 million in the US in its first week of release – a relatively large amount for a documentary, albeit it one shown in an unusually high 1,500 cinemas nationwide and plugged incessantly by the commander-in-chief across his social media channels.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>But that figure dropped to $3.57 million in its second week, down 67 per cent on the previous week, and just $886,000 in its third, a massive drop of 75 per cent. With US cinemas tending to keep half of all ticket sales for themselves, Amazon has so far recouped an estimated $7.7 million on its whopping investment. The firm paid a staggering $40 million to acquire the rights, despite a lack of any serious competition, then shelled out $35 million on marketing it.</p>

<p>When Amazon acquired <em>Melania</em> in early 2025, a studio spokesperson said, “We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only – because we think customers are going to love it.”</p>

<p>But by a remarkable coincidence, the company has done very well indeed out of new tax laws introduced by President Trump’s administration. According to a securities filing made last week, the company’s current US taxes, an accounting measure of taxes incurred last year, declined to $1.2 billion from $9 billion. Meanwhile, its pretax US profit increased by 44.5%, to $89.5 billion. On a cash basis, the company paid $2.8 billion in federal income taxes last year after paying more than $7 billion in each of the prior two years.</p>

<p>It comes as a result of a law signed by Trump last July both allowing companies to claim immediate deductions for certain capital investments, and permitting immediate deductions for new domestic research. Amazon lobbied on the tax bill and was involved in pushing for the changes to the research deduction.</p>

<p>So they may be being mocked for their crappy documentary – but that $75m is a drop in the ocean compared to the huge benefits the behemoth just happens to be pulling in thanks to Trump.</p>

<p>“Don’t let mad Zack hypnotise you into voting Green,” Reform by-election candidate Matt Goodwin shouts into a microphone in a sing-song voice, atop a double-decker bus. “They wanna legalise all drugs, crack cocaine and heroin. They want open border chaos. Keir Starmer looks like a robot. Doesn’t understand the British people. Vote Reform.”</p>

<p>Goodwin looks somewhat uncomfortable as he chants, perhaps because there is very obviously no-one around to listen to him. The clip has been posted by Goodwin to social media, but one thing is conspicuously missing from the background – people. </p>

<p>The constituency has a population of around 114,000, and no shortage of busy streets, but for some reason Goodwin and the Reform battle bus isn’t, in the footage at least, anywhere near any of them. Instead, the bus is passing through a motorway underpass at the edge of the constituency and onto the industrial estate that houses Reform’s campaign HQ, on a road that contains very little housing.</p>

<p>The bus incident wasn’t the only extremely online incident for Goodwin this week, after he posted a picture of himself outside a house plastered in “Vote Matt Goodwin” posters – which were very obviously AI generated, once you looked for more than the briefest of moments. Could he really not find a real poster to pose by?</p>

<p>Reform clearly have the money to fight this by-election: they’ve been paying printers to distribute leaflets, they have a huge warehouse HQ, and even a double-decker Reform battle bus. But is their campaign happening more on the internet than in person?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The US secretary of state told his audience he was only being tough on Europe because he loved it. It was almost as offensive as JD Vance a year earlier]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Watching and hearing JD Vance being booed at the Winter Olympics in Italy, I wondered whether he might decide to hang around in Europe, and head to the Munich Security Conference for a repeat of his greatest hit exactly one year ago.</p>

<p>That was the moment the US vice president filled a huge bucket with America First bile and proceeded to empty it all over the heads of assorted European leaders, diplomats, military top brass, spooks and foreign policy geeks.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>At the time, you may remember, the world was waiting to discover how the Trump administration would belatedly deliver on the promise to “end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours,” and deal with the seeming acceleration of Vladimir Putin’s onslaught on civilian life and infrastructure. Given that Vance virtually ignored the war, instead choosing to condemn Europe for our alleged loathing of free speech, alongside other assorted gaslighting insults, before heading off to meet the leader of the hard right AfD, it is hard to overstate just how deep into the wounds of diplomacy his words struck. </p>

<p>And that is why, one year on, people gathered here were still talking about his speech, and the context it laid for so much that has followed in the 12 months since, from Trump’s continuing bromance with Putin to his UN-bypassing, unilateral interventions in trouble spots around the world, and above all perhaps – for this audience at least – his Nato-busting desire to add Greenland to US territory, a claim he repeated on the eve of the conference.</p>

<p>In the end, Vance scuttled home from Italy, and it was left to US secretary of state Marco Rubio to lead the US delegation here. His Saturday morning Valentine’s Day speech was perhaps the most anticipated of the three-day event, so it was very much standing room only, and by the end, many of those lucky enough to get seats rose to their feet to give Rubio something close to a standing ovation.</p>

<p>Watching and hearing the response, I made a note to add “Rubio Munich 2026” to my list, for the next time I address the issue of expectation management. Here were some of the smartest people in Europe, at a time of geopolitical turmoil, falling for one of the oldest tricks in the book… make people think what is coming is truly terrible, so that when it is only awful, it feels OK. </p>

<p>Those who seemed to fall for it included the MSC chair, diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who began his post-speech Q&amp;A with Rubio by suggesting there was a huge sigh of relief in the room at “the message of reassurance and partnership” we had just heard. I’m sorry, but that was not what I heard. </p>

<p>For sure, Rubio’s speech was better written and with more charming grace notes than we heard in the same room from Vance last year. But this was no Valentine’s Day missive of love.</p>

<p>Once you stripped away the warm words about Shakespeare and the Beatles, Mozart and Michelangelo, and even warmer words about Europe’s role in bringing the USA into being, and any American being “a child of Europe,” the message was virtually identical to Vance’s: You guys have lost the plot. You’ve let immigration and woke destroy your culture and Christian faith. The UN is a failure. Nothing good happens without the US, Nothing much happens at all without Trump. </p>

<p>The “rules-based global order,” which Rubio spent most of his pre-Trump life supporting, was now a “foolish idea… a delusion.” He railed at European welfare, suggested our energy policies existed to “appease a climate cult,” (this at a time California risks burning to extinction while Florida risks sinking).</p>

<p>Yes, the US made mistakes too, he said, but that was before The Great Orange Leader came to save us from our follies, and deliver “renewal and restoration” for America and the world. </p>

<p>Rubio will have been purring inside at the Ischinger response, and the sight of a good chunk of the audience rising to its feet. Resolutely stuck to my seat, my head now shaking at the communal naivety, I wondered, am I too deep into Trump Derangement Syndrome not to be able to see why he merited such a response? </p>

<p>So I went away and read carefully the text of what I had just heard, and if anything, it made me more alarmed by the substance, not less. I then bumped into a German official, we chatted about the speech, and her judgement was even harsher than mine.</p>

<p>She said she had a close friend who had been a victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband. “That was like watching the diplomatic version of what happened to my friend,” she said of what we had just witnessed, and then went into a riff, imagining Rubio as the abusing partner in America’s relationship with Europe:</p>

<p>“Listen, honey, we go back a long way, we are a team… and I am being tough on you because I love you so much, and I don’t want to lose you … so this is for your own good… WHACK!… I know it hurts and I know it is making you doubt me, but honestly in the long run, this is best for both of us… WHACK! We will emerge stronger but you just have to do as you’re told… WHACK!”</p>

<p>Later, I attended a panel on Arctic security. Not least thanks to Trump, and his claims on Greenland, there was a big crowd trying to get in, a Norwegian civil servant joking that “normally, we struggle to fill the front row.” </p>

<p>Both Mette Frederikson, prime minister of Denmark, and Greenland PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen were on the panel, she nursing a cold, he looking a little pale and stressed. They were joined by the foreign ministers of Germany and Canada, Boris Pistorius and Anita Anand, and Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska. They were all united in their condemnation of US claims on Greenland.</p>

<p>“The pressure on us is unacceptable,” said Nielsen. “But this is not only about Greenland. Imagine a Nato country threatening an ally, like we are just a puzzle in a big game.”</p>

<p>Earlier, I listened to Elbridge Colby, US under-secretary of defence, said to be one of the authors of the Americans’ new National Security Strategy, which has a lot to say about Europe’s so-called “civilisational erasure,” and not a word about Taiwan.</p>

<p>Colby was asked very directly whether, if a Nato ally like Estonia was attacked by Russia, the US would abide by the Article 5 principle that an attack on one was an attack on all. It was, as he was subsequently reminded, a straight Yes or No question. </p>

<p>His answer was a long-winded mini-lecture, with lots about Nato 1.0, 2.0 and now Nato 3.0, whatever that means; a dismissal of the question on Article 5 as “theological framing”;  a sideswipe at “the liberal rules-based order”; a quote from former German chancellor Konrad Adenauer that “you can’t rely on the Americans all the time… it’s not reasonable.”</p>

<p>What I took from it all was that his answer to the Yes-No question was, basically, No. Rubio put it far more eloquently than either Vance last year, or Colby now. But the message is the same. </p>

<p>Europe needs to face that, not pretend that just because Rubio had diluted the Vance bile a little, somehow we are all best buddies again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Green candidate – a local plumber – is convinced she can win. But does a Labour-Green fight risk splitting the vote on the left, and handing the seat to Reform?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Few visitors to Manchester come for the weather, especially in February. The Green Party, then, was surely feeling ambitious when it opted for Granada Park as its muster point for a by-election day of action in the constituency of Gorton and Denton.</p>

<p>The ground is already soft – the grass will soon become a quagmire – and the ominous sky suggests the current break in the rain will not last. Nonetheless, from 10am on this Saturday morning, the park fills with volunteers from across the UK, first as a trickle and then as a flood.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Activists make polite small talk as they wait for the leader of the Green Party, Zack Polanski, and their by-election candidate Hannah Spencer to arrive. “I think I recognise your dog,” one man says to another. “Yes, Lucifer! Yeah, he’s gone viral a few times online,” says the proud owner of a tiny black Pomeranian, as someone nearby mumbles that he hopes the dog’s name gets shortened to “Lucy” when meeting on the doorstep. </p>

<p>The mood is good as the crowd grows, and grows, first to 100, then to twice that, reaching a comfortable 300-400 by the time Polanski and Spencer arrive from some early morning media interviews. The mass of activists cheer as they see the pair coming. “I love it, you just get used to this,” an obviously delighted Polanski says quietly to Spencer.</p>

<p>Polanski greets the crowd, then almost immediately turns his back to them (after a quick apology for “how weird this looks”) to give a speech to a small huddle of cameras instead, using them as a backdrop. </p>

<p>His anger is mostly focused on the “rot” of Labour, condemning Keir Starmer for bringing Peter Mandelson “into the heart of government” despite knowing “he was friends with a notorious paedophile”. Wes Streeting is condemned for signing new contracts with Palantir to increase their involvement with NHS data. “The Labour government came in and promised change,” Polanski sums up. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed but there’s not been much change.”</p>

<p>He frames the election – which is taking place in what was, less than two years ago, one of Labour’s safest seats in the nation – as a two-way fight between the Green Party and Reform. “It’s hate versus hope, and we know who’s gonna win,” he says, trying to rouse up the crowd. “Who’s gonna win?”</p>

<p>After a false start in which one man accidentally seems to shout “hate” – not everyone is fully awake yet – the crowd shouts “hope”, Spencer says a few words, and the assembled party activists are given their assignments. </p>

<p>The campaign manager, whose name is Miles, tells them that speaking to voters is the most valuable thing people can do, if they’re willing – especially if they can persuade people to “paint the constituency green” by putting up posters in their yards and windows. If they’d rather not do that, then they can help by delivering leaflets. </p>

<p>The energy and the mood is obviously with the Greens, even if success brings its own problems. Miles is relentlessly upbeat when talking to the group, but is obviously fretting when addressing his small core team, as long lines of activists are standing around waiting to be told what to do. “We should never have queues of activists who can’t do work, it should never exist,” he fusses. “We’re having teething problems.”</p>

<p>The ambition is palpable: the Green Party feel that they can win this seat, and they are absolutely determined to do it. But despite Polanski’s claim that Gorton and Denton is a two-way race, they have two opponents – telling two different stories – to overcome.</p>

<p>Labour are not about to let this constituency go without a fight, and Manchester Labour – a strong brand in its own right – is throwing everything it has at the seat. Andy Burnham, despite being blocked from standing as the candidate himself, has campaigned in the seat three times in a week. On the day I visit, Labour has managed to muster hundreds of its own activists to the seat. </p>

<p>The campaign’s organisers say everyone in the Cabinet – barring Keir Starmer himself – has been to visit. Asked if they’d like a visit from the PM himself, they politely deflect. He is very busy, they note. It wouldn’t be unusual if he didn’t come. </p>

<p>Labour insists that the contest is between them and Reform, and that a vote for the Greens only risks handing the seat to the Reform candidate, the Substacker Matt Goodwin. They argue that the Greens have no real grounding in Gorton and Denton, with no local councillors in the constituency.</p>

<p>Labour is also trying to ground the argument in terms of what the winning candidate can do for Manchester. The new MP will represent the seat until the next general election. That means, for the next few years at least, working with a Labour government, a Labour mayor, Labour councils, and neighbouring Labour MPs. Who, they ask rhetorically, will do that best?</p>

<p>As I criss-cross the constituency, I run into chatty, cheerful groups of Greens seemingly everywhere I go – but on at least three occasions, I also run into slightly warier but friendly enough Labour canvassers. The Greens have the zest of the challenger, while Labour has the infrastructure and local knowledge of the incumbent. </p>

<p>Given the noise around Reform, the party feels less of a presence in the constituency itself. It is certainly less friendly – or at least to this journalist. On the main street of Levenshulme, which is the more diverse and more hipster end of the constituency, I bump into a group of seven Asian women all carrying large stacks of leaflets for Reform.</p>

<p>After taking a quick picture on my phone, I try to say hello, only to be abruptly shouted down. “Delete that. You can’t take a photo of this,” one tells me. I note it’s a public street, and start trying to introduce myself as a journalist, but she mutters something inaudible and turns sharply away, making it clear the conversation – such as it is – is over.</p>

<p>Reform’s campaign headquarters is located over on the other side of the constituency, on an industrial estate near Denton – the older, whiter, more working-class end of the seat. If Levenshulme is the kind of Labour heartland where they might worry about a challenge from the left, Denton is where they would worry about Reform. Reality is messier than that, of course. Levenshulme still has plenty of older white residents, and Denton is far from uniformly white.</p>

<p>The Reform HQ is, frankly, weird. Usually parties set up shop on or near the high street in the constituency, making it easy for volunteers to wander in and out, and keeping the campaign visible in the community.</p>

<p>Reform has rented an entire warehouse, a huge red shed set well back from the street and separated from almost everything else in the seat by both the M60 and the M67. The trickle of activists entering and leaving Reform’s HQ are all doing so by car. A security guard in the car park peers suspiciously as I look in from the street side. </p>

<p>Reform are certainly managing to blanket the constituency in leaflets, but many of these have been sent by post, paid for rather than delivered by volunteers. One contentious mailing, a letter written in the voice of a 74-year-old woman who has switched her vote from Labour to Reform, was posted out without the legally-required imprints saying which campaign sent it – an apparent breach of election law.</p>

<p>Even in Denton, I struggle to find Reform canvassers out in the wild. Eventually, I find a man leafleting a run-down row of two up, two down terraced houses on his own – except it turns out he’s another Green volunteer. They are, he insists, campaigning for every vote in the seat.</p>

<p>The Reform narrative, from its online materials and its leaflets, is a mirror image of the Greens. The seat, Reform insists, is a two-way contest between the Greens and Reform, so anyone wanting to stop a radical green activist becoming their MP should vote Reform. Both parties claim a victory for them would be the biggest embarrassment for Starmer.</p>

<p>Later in the day, I catch up with the Green candidate, Hannah Spencer, as she continues doorknocking. As I find her group, she is offering Kendal mint cake to anyone who will take it – including me – and hugging her goodbyes to Polanski’s boyfriend Ritchie, who has been canvassing with her all morning. </p>

<p>Spencer runs me through her biography: she is a plumber – she is clearly furious at allegations from GB News presenters and right-wing influencers claiming otherwise – and a Manchester lifer and local councillor. She has four rescue greyhounds (Forrest, Will, Olive and Judy), and is currently door knocking in the area she used to live when she got her first greyhound.</p>

<p>She knew campaigning would be an all-out thing, she says, but even so she has been shocked by all the “lies” spreading about her. “People hate you, right? It’s weird,” she notes. The oddest story going around, she says, is a claim that she is married to the chief executive of AstraZeneca (she is not). “It’s just one of those bonkers … what has happened on the internet is things have just escalated.”</p>

<p>In the 2024 general election, more than three-quarters of voters cast their ballot for a left-wing or centre-left candidate – Labour, the Greens, the Workers Party or the Liberal Democrats. Reform and the Conservatives managed less than 25% between them.</p>

<p>This is, I suggest, a seat that Reform can only win if the left-wing vote splits very evenly, letting Reform scrape ahead. Does she worry that her energetic campaign in a Labour stronghold might create the perfect storm to do just that?</p>

<p>“I just think we’re past that,” she says. “Now, I think ours and Labor’s politics aren’t the same. I don’t think it’s a case of splitting the vote. I don’t think they’re what people would say is left wing. I think they are so far beyond that… I think we’re three very different parties.”</p>

<p>Spencer has one focus other than Gorton and Denton on her mind for the next few weeks: she has been taking a course in plastering, and she is determined to complete it – her final exam is a few days away when we speak. Given plumbers are hardly short of work, she acknowledges it may not be essential, but says she had always wanted to learn it, and in her current circumstances “it keeps you grounded a little”. It is, she says, the nearest she gets to downtime.</p>

<p>Should she win the election, Spencer plans to campaign on the issue of fuel poverty – one she says affects a lot of people in the seat.</p>

<p>“The frustration [for] someone like me from a background of plumbing, like working in the building industry, all of us as experts, all of us tradespeople can see what the problems are, but no one’s ever been listening to us for decades,” she says. “We have been saying, this is broken, let’s fix it. And no one cares, because we’re not part of the elite that gets a seat at the table.”</p>

<p>Might that expertise also be useful for the renovations of the Palace of Westminster – now expected to cost tens of billions and take decades, if parliament doesn’t burn down first – I ask.</p>

<p>“Get us down there,” she laughs. “We’d have that fixed in months.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[My rent is about to jump by well over 10% and I’m not alone in my struggle. Why aren’t alarm bells ringing for the government? ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The thing about being an optimist is that you can stomach more bad news than your average person. If, deep in your soul, you have this feeling that things will probably work out, then you will find it easier to deal with short-term unpleasantness, as you know it is merely transient. </p>

<p>That’s how I see it anyway: I’m an optimist, both by nature and by training, and I rarely let small setbacks get to me. Well, not for long anyway. I’ll whinge and complain and roll my eyes then get back to scanning the horizon, and waiting for nicer things to start flying in my direction.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>I received a letter this week which tested this. Letters just aren’t good news in 2026, are they? I couldn’t tell you when I last opened one and proceeded to have a good time. I had no great expectations when I opened this one letter from my landlord, and that only made it more painful.</p>

<p>As it turns out, my rent will be going up by £184 a month from April. I read the figure then read it again: for a short but blissful amount of time, I assumed that I’d somehow misunderstood it, or they’d got it wrong. Eventually, I had no choice but to accept the unacceptable. </p>

<p>My rent went up by £100 a month last year and this year it’s going up by nearly twice that. I live alone and am attached to my little flat, so will have no choice but to find a way to squeeze those extra pounds out of my budget. I know I can do it: I’m financially responsible and am always on top of my finances. It’ll be fine.</p>

<p>In fact, by the end of that fateful day, my mood had picked up again. I wasn’t exactly thrilled, and I struggled to find silver linings, but I knew things were going to be okay. The “how”, “when” and “why” of things actually getting better still eluded me, but again: it’s just who I am. </p>

<p>I remained fairly buoyant for a few days after that, until I came across a report in the <em>Financial Times</em> which made my soul sink down into my socks. “In order to alleviate its acute housing affordability crisis, London has been set a target of building 88,000 new homes per year over the next decade,” the piece started. So far so good! Targets are useful and it is encouraging that they’re being set. Sure, they’re only a first step, but one in the right direction. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, “last year construction started on just 5,891 – 94% below target, a 75% year-on-year decline, the steepest drop in the country, the lowest tally since records began almost 40 years ago and the lowest figure for any major city in the developed world this century.”</p>

<p>Now, there are several reasons behind these absolutely, earth-shatteringly catastrophic figures. The introduction of the Building Safety Regulator after the Grenfell Tower fire was one of them. A good idea in theory, the organisation isn’t actually well-resourced enough to do its job, meaning that projects now languish and their costs balloon as the BSR works through its logjams at a glacial pace. </p>

<p>Other elements, like enhanced environmental regulations, are similar: good on paper, but problematic in reality. They’re also not wholly relevant to the matter at hand. Mostly, what I would like to ask is: what now? I’m currently financially able to rent a one bedroom flat in a London neighbourhood that’s reasonably central but achingly uncool. This is possible to me because I earn quite considerably more than the average UK wage.</p>

<p>Still, my rent is about to go up by well over 10%, and there is no world in which my earnings will increase by that much anytime soon. What will happen to me next year? There is a point at which I hope that, if things keep going well, my partner and I will move in together, and perhaps even consider buying a place of our own.</p>

<p>How will that be possible in a world where housing is currently unaffordable and nothing is being done to change that? I’m an optimist but I’m not insane. Even my inner belief that things will probably turn out fine has to feed on facts, once in a while. As things stand, I can’t find anything to hold onto.</p>

<p>That’s an issue for me, but I’d argue it’s a wider problem too. If you start losing the glass-half-full people, then alarm bells ought to start ringing in government and elsewhere. There are a lot of people who can deal with day-to-day miseries if they have faith that better days are coming but, once that goes, what exactly are they meant to do?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Emerald Fennell’s third film is far from a well-behaved literary adaptation, but it's thoroughly enjoyable]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<h3><strong>PICK OF THE WEEK</strong></h3>

<h3 id="h-wuthering-heights-general-release"><strong><em>“Wuthering Heights”</em> </strong>(general release)</h3>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>In her great 1964 essay on the subject, Susan Sontag wrote that “Camp sees everything in quotation marks.” It is a shame that she is not around to render aesthetic judgment on Emerald Fennell’s third movie because I am pretty sure she would say: “Wow. Now <em>that</em> is camp.”</p>

<p>The quotation marks around the movie’s title are a big clue. My favourite adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel – first published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell – is still Andrea Arnold’s rough-hewn, elemental film of 2011 (also the first in which Black actors played Heathcliff, who is described in the book as “a dark-skinned gipsy”). </p>

<p>But Fennell’s take on the story is not really an adaptation: more like a version of a version of a version; inspired, as she has said, by her memories of the novel when she fell in love with it aged 14. She does not so much take liberties with the text as unleash fabulous anarchy upon it.</p>

<p>In the leading roles, for a start, she has unashamedly cast two ridiculously good-looking screen stars – Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff – with an eye to making a film that will be “this generation’s <em>Titanic</em>” rather than to appease campus literary critics. The character of Cathy’s brother Hindley is dispensed with entirely and Isabella (Alison Oliver) becomes the ward of Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) rather than his sister. Mr Earnshaw (Martin Clunes, splendid) is much more prominent than in Brontë’s original.</p>

<p>Thrushcross Grange, the Lintons’ home – which becomes Cathy’s too when she marries Edgar – is less a Yorkshire manor house than a hyper-real palace of vast spaces, primary colours and kitsch modernity. Costume designer Jacqueline Durran ditches historical accuracy in favour of fever-dream impact, mixing vintage Thierry Mugler and Alexander McQueen with Chanel jewellery, Russian hats and cellophane. </p>

<p>When Heathcliff, dismayed by Cathy’s marriage, deserts Wuthering Heights and then returns years later, wealthy and well-groomed, he looks more like a Britpop Byron than a Georgian entrepreneur. And the love of his life, the childhood friend with whom he ran across the crags and fields, is now a fairy tale princess, apparently dressed by Balenciaga.</p>

<p>Add in the soundtrack by Charli xcx, and you have a movie that owes much more to acid culture, rock videos that go heavy on the dry ice, Wes Anderson formalism, and behind-the-scenes fashion sizzle reels than to the traditions of the well-behaved literary adaptation. This is truly an exercise in world-building rather than narrowly bookish homage.</p>

<p>Fans of Fennell’s <em>Saltburn </em>(2023) will not be surprised by the movie’s steaminess – far more explicit than the suggested passion in the book, though true to its Freudian juxtaposition of Eros and Thanatos. The film could also not make the moorland more fetishistic if it tried: this really is <em>Fifty Shades of Grouse</em>.</p>

<p>As I say, Arnold’s adaptation is still top of my list. But I truly enjoyed Fennell’s dialled-up vision and its counter-cultural determination to thumb its nose at contemporary primness and tone policing. “Nobody likes a sourpuss,” says Mr Earnshaw. “Now where’s my fucking horse?” Exactly.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Crime 101</em> </strong>(general release)</h3>

<p>“What do you see? What do you feel? Remember that there’s great power within you.” The meditation app favoured by Los Angeles insurance broker Sharon Colvin (Halle Berry) provides an intermittent Zen commentary to Bart Layton’s terrific heist thriller; its soothing affirmations sharply at odds with the status anxiety, pulsing greed and compressed resentments of its characters.</p>

<p>Inspired by Don Winslow’s hardboiled 2020 novella – which was dedicated to Elmore Leonard – <em>Crime 101</em> takes its title from the course designation given to US college starter classes. But there’s a double meaning in the allusion to Highway 101, the north-south route on the Pacific coast along which jewel thief Mike (Chris Hemsworth) has carried out a series of meticulous robberies. </p>

<p>Alone in his department, LAPD detective Lou Lubesnick (Mark Ruffalo, now well-established in his paunchy cop phase after last year’s excellent <em>Task</em>) spots this geographic pattern, matched by the consistent non-violence of the thefts. </p>

<p>“People who grow up in chaos crave order,” Sharon tells Mike when he seeks to involve her in a huge criminal payday. The tension between smooth surfaces and internal bedlam – in LA itself and its citizens – is at the heart of the movie.</p>

<p>And never more so than when Mike’s seen-it-all mentor and fence Money (Nick Nolte) loses confidence in him and recruits the trigger-happy biker Ormon (Barry Keoghan) to take over his scores. Not since the arrival of drug dealer Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector) in season three of <em>The Wire </em>has there been a more captivating, reckless pretender to criminal dominion. </p>

<p>Blonde-thatched, twitchy and ultra-violent, Keoghan’s character is a daemon consumed by ambition and fury; a chaos agent who sneers at Mike’s caution and his dream of a life free from crime. </p>

<p><em>Crime 101</em> is an explicit love letter to the movies of Michael Mann, including <em>Thief </em>(1981), <em>Collateral </em>(2004) and – especially – <em>Heat</em> (1995): Mike’s tentative romance with Maya (Monica Barbaro) is a nod to the fateful relationship between ice-cool thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and graphic designer Eady (Amy Brenneman).</p>

<p>But Layton’s homage is not confined to one director: the influence of William Friedkin is also clear in the spectacular car chases (best enjoyed in 4DX). In a wonderful scene towards the end of the film – in which both men are pretending to be someone else – Lou and Mike discuss the relative merits of Steve McQueen’s most iconic roles.</p>

<p>The cast is superb: Jennifer Jason Leigh appears in only two scenes as Lou’s soon-to-be-ex-wife Angie and is still memorable. Corey Hawkins is great as Lou’s exasperated partner, Detective Tillman. So is Tate Donovan as Monroe, one of Sharon’s plutocratic clients whom Mike selects as his final mark. </p>

<p>“You hold the power to create all that you desire out of nothing,” says the app. That’s the delusion with which all the characters struggle in <em>Crime 101</em>, and the incantation that the City of Angels itself whispers to them, and to us.</p>

<h3>THEATRE</h3>

<h3><strong><em>Dracula</em> </strong>(Noël Coward Theatre, London, until May 30)</h3>

<p>From the moment that Cynthia Erivo walks onstage, lies down and begins to speak as Jonathan Harker – the young lawyer despatched to Transylvania to arrange a property deal with Count Dracula – she commands the attention of the audience with extraordinary power and agility. </p>

<p>Thirteen years after her acclaimed performance as Celie in <em>The Color Purple</em> at<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Menier Chocolate Factory, which transferred to Broadway<em>, </em>one is reminded of her greatness as a stage performer. In this adaptation of Bram Stoker’s 1897 horror classic – following his triumph with Sarah Snook in <em>The Portrait of Dorian Gray</em> in 2024 – Kip Williams once again entrusts the whole story to a lone actor. Once again, the theatrical experience is riveting.</p>

<p>In taking on 23 roles, and narrating a 20,000-word script, Erivo is more than a quick-change artist. Yes, as the doomed Lucy Westenra she wears a white dress and long blonde wig; as Professor Abraham Van Helsing she has the beard of a sage and the golden crucifix of a vampire hunter; as Dr Jack Seward, administrator of the asylum near the count’s new estate, Carfax, she adopts the guise of a fretful Victorian gentleman; as Quincey P Morris, Lucy’s Stetson-wearing suitor, she plays up the character’s Texan swagger and wit; and – best of all – as Dracula himself, with red hair, natty white suit, fangs and talons, she portrays a creature of diabolical charisma, supernatural power and (unexpectedly) pathos.</p>

<p>Yet none of this would be work – or work so well – were it not for the connective tissue of Erivo’s storytelling voice. As ever, Williams uses screens, Steadicams, music and imaginative set design to great effect: achieving a hypermodern form of drama in which the solo actor is constantly interacting with versions of herself and high-tech visual effects, in what amounts to cybernetic theatre.</p>

<p>“I am not a creature of the underworld,” says the count. “I am a thing of the mind.” That the line rings so true is a tribute to the success of this audacious and absorbing production.</p>

<h3><strong>BOOK</strong></h3>

<h3><strong><em>The Score: How to Stop Playing Someone Else’s Game</em>, by C Thi Nguyen </strong>(Allen Lane)</h3>

<p>From time to time, a book comes along that causes the reader to reconsider just about everything. In <em>The Score</em>, C Thi Nguyen, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, deploys his scholarly research on games, values and rankings as a prism to reinterpret our hypermodern world. The results are extraordinary.</p>

<p>Central to his thesis is what he calls “<em>value capture</em>” which “<em>occurs when you get your values from some external source and let them rule you without adapting them.</em>” Metrics, he readily acknowledges, have many constructive uses; but they can also become tyrannical, deadening and a poor guide to what matters in life.</p>

<p>So desperate are we to chase social media clicks and likes, or better academic grades, or higher rankings for the services we offer, that we lose sight of nuance, subtlety and joy. “If we let institutional metrics set our values and drive our lives,” Nguyen writes, “we end up chasing what’s easy to count, and not what’s really important.” </p>

<p>This leads, ultimately, to <em>value collapse</em>: “a feedback loop whereby over-simplifying your values changes how you approach the world, what you notice about it, and what you spend time exploring.” We are hypnotised by a process of “objectivity laundering” that makes us the serfs of metrics we imagine to be value-neutral – but are no such thing.</p>

<p>So what to do? Ingeniously, Nguyen detects in games (broadly understood) a healthy, flexible form of score keeping and an enriching form of endeavour that he calls “striving play”. Every game has an objective, of course, but “we adopt a goal in order to have the struggle that we really want.”</p>

<p>Whether playing pickup basketball, charades or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, we strategically pursue an objective in order to engage in a challenge that we find intrinsically enjoyable. “Games offer <em>value clarity</em>,” he writes. “They are an existential balm for the confusion of ordinary life.” </p>

<p>Part intellectual thesis, part memoir, part carnival of personal enthusiasms (it begins with the author’s joyous discovery of rock climbing), <em>The Score</em> is beautifully written and full of aphoristic wit. Games are “metrics methadone”; “a kind of spiritual vaccine, an inoculation against the harsher institutional scoring systems that they resemble”; and (best of all) “toy governments, but for fun.”</p>

<p>This rigorous comparison of institutional metrics and games supports his central message that “[t]he meaning of life is not in the outcome but the process.” At their best, games “offer the possibility of a splintered, decentralized, hyper-tailored form of life.”</p>

<p>C Thi Nguyen will be talking to <em>TNW</em> founder and editor-in-chief Matt Kelly and me in a forthcoming episode of <em>The Two Matts</em>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A quarter of a million Rohingya people have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. In the camps there is almost unimaginable suffering, danger and a longing for another life]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Abdullah Wahed sat cross-legged next to his wife, Sadia, on the dark floor of their windowless shelter in southern Bangladesh. Between them, where the thick air trapped inside is coolest, their two young children lay beside one another, staring up at Abdullah’s large, dark eyes.</p>

<p>“There used to be these endless green fields that stretched as far as our eyes could see,” Abdullah recalled with a boyish grin. His gaze seemed to pass through his son and daughter and settle somewhere far away from the cracked bamboo walls around them.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>It was on these fields which rolled through arching hills that Abdullah used to play football with the other kids from his small village in Buthidaung, Rakhine State in western Myanmar.</p>

<p>But that was before the games ended. Before they stopped him from going to school and before the medicine started running out. Before he took his mother by the arm and led her from their family home into dark jungles and across wild rivers to Bangladesh and before his own country’s army burned babies, gang-raped young mothers and executed their husbands across Rakhine, the home of an ethnic Muslim population called the Rohingya, described by the United Nations as the “world’s most persecuted people.”</p>

<p>A peaceful return for the Rohingya remains a distant hope. A carefully-controlled election has taken place in Myanmar, which has been widely disregarded by the international community. But its results will be used to legitimise the junta’s control over the country and further cement their long campaign of genocidal violence against the Rohingya people.</p>

<p>Abdullah, now 25, has spent the last eight years in Bangladesh encased in bamboo and tarpaulin in Camp 4 of the world’s largest refugee camp.</p>

<p>There, in the sprawling network of 33 camps, Abdullah became a man, a husband, a father, and a prisoner, stuck in a fragile limbo between the country that made him stateless and the Rohingyas’ reluctant host nation, Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Over 750,000 Rohingya people fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in 2017 after 50 years of discrimination escalated to horrifying mass killings perpetrated by the Myanmar army, which Human Rights Watch called an “act of genocide.”</p>

<p>Many, including Abdullah and his mother, arrived at the Bangladesh camps beaten, bloodied and exhausted. Bangladesh refused to call Rohingya people “refugees”, but granted them shelter in multiplying camps built across a deforested area near the coastal city of Cox’s Bazar.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, billions of dollars of humanitarian aid poured into Bangladesh. Shelters, education centres, health facilities and makeshift dirt roads were quickly built. Even a Rohingya Cultural Memory Centre, sympathetically designed by Dhaka-based architect, Rizvi Hassan was built on a hill in Camp 18 and filled with artwork, traditional farming tools and tiny model villages depicting the wide fields, snaking rivers and rolling hills. It was designed as a tool for remembrance.</p>

<p>But almost every single building in the camps, from small shelters to hospitals share one thing in common: they were built to be temporary, designed to discourage any feelings of permanence, and deliberately constructed with removable pre-cast columns and nut bolt joints so they could be quickly dismantled when the Rohingya refugees are sent back.</p>

<p>“Even the memory centre was built so it could be taken down in around five days,” Rizvi Hassan told <em>The New World</em>.</p>

<p>33 camps built to be torn down mean the Rohingya refugees – who are forbidden by the Bangladeshi government to work, earn money, participate in formal education or leave the camps without permission – are trapped in a cycle of temporary existence, increasingly vulnerable to climate disasters and entirely dependent on vast sums of foreign aid to survive.</p>

<p>Now that aid is drying up. Only 38% of the $934.6 million needed to maintain life-saving assistance was secured by October last year. In the last 24 months, 200,000 more Rohingya refugees have arrived there as civil war escalates.</p>

<p>Aid cuts have not only exposed the Rohingya to horrific levels of human suffering but revealed the weaknesses in policies of dependence and containment that crop up when a host country refuses to give basic human rights to its refugee population.</p>

<p>Shortly before 11am in Camp 15, the sound of crying children permeated through most of its tight pathways. But in the queue for life-saving nutritional supplements at a UNICEF nutrition facility, hundreds of babies lying limp in their mothers’ arms were eerily quiet.</p>

<p>“Without funding, 14,500 children will likely die of severe acute malnutrition next year,” Dr. Owen Nkhoma, a specialist at the facility, told <em>The New World</em>.</p>

<p>Severe malnutrition in children under five years is up 11% as of September 2025. Mothers, like Juda Bibi, 35, who propped up her young son on weighing scales, described how “there simply isn’t enough food for everyone right now.” </p>

<p>Others like Romida Alom, 41, who is unable to breastfeed, said her young son, who weighed just 1kg when he was born, would die without the nutritional supplements she collects every week from the facility.</p>

<p>Without additional aid, the UN has warned that by mid-2026 food rations will be halved. Primary health services were either completely shuttered or drastically reduced at 48 health facilities after USAID cuts. 55% of education centres, which keep hundreds of thousands of children away from increasing numbers of trafficking and drug gangs in the camps, were forced to close in recent months following the cuts.</p>

<p>The alternative to this dire situation, which remains off the table of current leader Muhammed Yunus, is to grant refugees the right to work. But in his government’s eyes, this would encourage them to stay in Bangladesh. There is also the uncomfortable reality that Bangladeshi communities around Cox’s Bazar already benefit from cheap, informal Rohingya labour. Refugees are working for extra food to supplement a monthly ration allowance of just $12 per person.</p>

<p>Disaster preparedness organisations like Acted, which is funded by the European Union, are also contending with natural disasters that have destroyed large parts of the camps in recent years.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains have caused landslides that snapped through bamboo and cut off access to care facilities. The region is predisposed to cyclones, like the one in May 2023 that damaged 3,000 shelters and destroyed learning centres, health facilities and mosques across all 33 camps.</p>

<p>Frequent droughts dry out the wooden shelters, turning homes and the propane gas bottles within them into a crude bomb. In the hope of preventing mass casualties, Acted has trained almost one thousand young Rohingya women as firefighters. Driving red and white rickshaws to access isolated homes, women like Sahan, 28, are the first line of fire defence in Camp 10.</p>

<p>Even during the usually stable climate in December, the narrow arterial walkways which snake through the camps crumble and break underfoot.</p>

<p>Outside his shelter in Camp 24, Shobul Alam’s large fist is clenched around the flimsy handle of his cane as he takes a shallow, laboured breath which barely inflates his broad, muscular chest.</p>

<p>“Stand up, Shobul” his father barked. “Look, watch this.”</p>

<p>With each pained grunt, Shobul’s jaw jutted out further. His forehead tightened and the veins in his neck bloated. Only a few seconds went by before his burly frame crashed back into the plastic red chair.</p>

<p>Shobul cannot speak or write or use the toilet alone. His brother, Mohammed, who communicates for him, said “he is in pain every minute of every day.”</p>

<p>A few years ago, Shobul fled Myanmar for Malaysia in search of work to earn money for his family in the Bangladeshi camps. There, he was involved in a traffic accident, which he barely survived. Rohingya refugees secured transport for him to the camps in Bangladesh where he was reunited with his family.</p>

<p>“We are more vulnerable in the camps now,” said Mohammed. “The gangs know we are weak and cannot run, so they come for us more than ever before. We are desperate to return home.”</p>

<p>But the chances of a safe return to Myanmar are minimal. Civil war is intensifying between the army and several militia groups. Earlier this month, the Myanmar Army launched a raid on a hospital in Rakhine state, killing and injuring dozens of children. UN rights chief, Volker Turk said the “attacks may amount to a war crime.”  </p>

<p>The absence of legal frameworks makes Rohingya people particularly vulnerable to human traffickers operating in the region. This year alone, the UN reported that 600 Rohingya had died or gone missing during maritime journeys in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Since the early 2000s, multiple mass Rohingya graves and human trafficking camps have been uncovered close to borders in Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

<p>China, which shares the largest land border with Myanmar, is also perpetrating a state-backed persecution of a minority Muslim population, which has received little support from neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>In the north-western region of Xinjiang, over a million Uyghur Muslims have been detained in “re-education camps”, some of which reportedly operate with a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. Thousands of Uyghurs have been forcibly disappeared from Xinjiang, while independent human rights tribunals held in London reported evidence of torture, rape, systematic suppression of births and forced organ extraction of the Uyghurs.</p>

<p>Since the start of the Rohingya crisis, China has repeatedly opposed humanitarian and political intervention in Myanmar, but continues to back their army, supplying them with attack drones and aircraft that have been used to carry out deadly airstrikes across Rakhine state.</p>

<p>Condemning Rohingya persecution would attract further global scrutiny on China’s own crimes against the Uyghurs. It would also alienate a close ally in Myanmar and damage the value of its huge investments in the country.</p>

<p>Instead, China continues to lobby for the repatriation of the Rohingyas deliberately overlooking the lethal threats they would face if they returned to Rakhine state.</p>

<p>At just 19 years old, Abdul Aziz has spent over a third of his life in Camp 16. He is desperate to study and become a doctor, but like most Rohingya people in the camps, he is desperately afraid for his family’s safety if they are forced to return to Rakhine.</p>

<p>At one of the last remaining vocational skills programmes still running in his camp, he said:</p>

<p>“I just want to learn how to build a plane, then fly it far away from here… anywhere, but here.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A booming land of opportunity, of young entrepreneurs and start-ups, is locked in a 50-50 culture war that could see it replace Hungary as the EU’s biggest internal nightmare]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Poland is barely an hour away by train or car from Berlin, and yet most Germans scratch their heads when you ask them the last time they visited their eastern neighbour. They would rather fly across Europe to their second homes in Mallorca or the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, the number of Poles living and working in Germany is decreasing as they see better job opportunities and higher growth back home.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for the <em>froideur</em>, and they reinforce each other. The past has re-emerged to poison the present, and the far right is exploiting it for all its worth.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>I’ve visited Poland many times, by plane from the UK and elsewhere, but – crazily – this was the first time I’d gone across the border in all my years of living in Germany. Polish trains leave the German capital’s central station every two hours. Mine was comfortable, but hardly busy. </p>

<p>From the comfortable vantage point of the restaurant car (remarkably they still have a kitchen and cook dishes from scratch), I remarked at how flat the snowy landscape was, all the way for five hours to Warsaw. How easy, I pondered tastelessly, it would have been to invade.</p>

<p>It’s understandable that a country which ceased to exist for over a century, and was then attacked and brutalised and occupied from east and west by the Nazis and Soviets, refuses to forget. The German-Polish Barometer, a survey of Poles and Germans that has been conducted at regular intervals since 2000, shows that Polish attitudes towards Germans have hit an all-time low. Meanwhile, unlike its equivalents across Europe, the populist authoritarian Law and Justice Party (PiS) in Poland is not smitten by Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin remains an object of deep suspicion.</p>

<p>There are few votes to be won in being warm about Germany, and even fewer when it comes to Russia. On everything else in Polish politics, where identity politics has long been centre-stage, opinion is radically split. Poland is stuck in an ugly 50:50 culture war, and the prospects are for worse to come. </p>

<p>The curiosity is that this is a country that for more than a decade has enjoyed consistently high growth of 4% and over – an extraordinary performance, particularly when compared with the anaemic performances of Britain, France and Germany. Warsaw is booming; other big cities are booming. Polish entrepreneurship and innovation are regarded by investors as among the continent’s most impressive. The days of Poles seeking fame and fortune abroad are long gone.</p>

<p>The Polish divide is, in one respect, no different to elsewhere – urban-metropolitan, higher-educated on the one hand, and small town and rural on the other. The Catholic Church continues to play a pivotal role, just as it did tacitly during the Solidarity uprisings of the 1980s and the collapse of Communism. In the absence of anything else, it has sought to provide the societal glue; alongside that have come some of Europe’s most restrictive laws on abortion and LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>With the best of intentions, Poland’s constitution has now unwittingly enshrined the split. Designed in the heady days of the early 1990s, it provides strong powers for both the president and government. The original aim was to prevent any single leader from accumulating too much power; instead, it has produced near-deadlock, with the far right Law and Justice Party (PiS) pitted against the mainstream conservative Civic Platform (now called Civic Coalition).</p>

<p>In the centrist corner is Donald Tusk. Having lost out in presidential elections in 2005 to the far right, he served as prime minister from 2007 to 2014, all the while having to fend off a presidency intent on blocking him. He made several attempts to change the constitution, but they failed to get the necessary super-majority in parliament. In 2015, in a foretaste of what was to come with Donald Trump I and Brexit, PiS won all levers of power and proceeded to sack anyone, anywhere who was remotely liberal. </p>

<p>Tusk went on to become president of the European Council for five years. The only Pole so far to have held high office in Brussels, he epitomises everything the anti-global populists loathe. In 2023, he returned as prime minister – only just, as only after the president tried and failed to engineer a different coalition – but in that time he has only managed to redress the balance slightly.</p>

<p>Last May it all went wrong, again. By a Brexit-style narrow majority of 51 to 49%, Poles opted for a historian and amateur boxer, Karol Nawrocki, as their president. Against the odds, Nawrocki defeated Rafał Trzaskowski, the experienced mayor of Warsaw, a centrist, and former MEP who speaks five languages. As is often the case, particularly in central and eastern Europe, big-city mayors do not translate nationally.</p>

<p>Nawrocki’s past is just a little colourful. The list of allegations accompanying him include whether he swindled an elderly man into transferring ownership of his apartment in the northern city of Gdańsk, to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-president-karol-nawrocki-scandals/">pimping at a luxury hotel</a> at Sopot, a beach resort nearby. It is an assertion Nawrocki strenuously denies. He also has a record of football hooliganism. None of these seemed unduly to bother his base.</p>

<p>He instead portrayed himself as being at the vanguard of Polish identity, declaring that “historical politics” would play a key role in his presidency. The narrative is focused on his countrymen’s record as heroes and victims, on “defence of Polish dignity”. </p>

<p>On day-to-day politics, Nawrocki pledged to veto anything passed by parliament that he disagreed with; and in his first six months he has largely done that. He is sceptical, in the extreme, about plans to borrow 43.7 billion euros of EU money under the loans-for-weapons SAFE program.<br><br>He has also assembled an apparatus to carry out his own version of foreign affairs. This presents a dilemma for foreign diplomats in Warsaw, having to deal with two national security advisers, and doubles in most areas of policy.</p>

<p>While the prime minister has sought to bring Poland closer to the heart of EU decision-making, the president has aligned himself firmly to Donald Trump and MAGA.</p>

<p>The US administration did everything it could to help Nawrocki get elected, inviting him to the White House in the middle of the campaign. A few weeks later, he received formal endorsement via Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary – she of shoot-on-sight ICE infamy in Minnesota – when she visited Poland to attend a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. </p>

<p>Like their counterparts from Germany’s AfD, like Nigel Farage, Poland’s far right politicians are warmly welcomed in Washington. They’re regulars at CPAC and other events, while the official Polish ambassador – accountable to Tusk and his foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, struggles to gain access.</p>

<p>Within weeks of taking office as president last August, Nawrocki went to see Trump for a second time in quick succession. In a break with tradition, he invited no representative from the Polish foreign ministry or embassy to the meeting.</p>

<p>The American approach is set out for all to see in the recently published National Security Strategy. The document makes clear the intention of the US administration to weaken the EU and to embrace right wing nationalists in Europe, be they in power, such as in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Italy, or bidding for it, such as in France. </p>

<p>In Poland, the battle is set to intensify. Tusk and everyone around him are looking nervously over their shoulders as parliamentary elections must be held by November 2027 at the latest. Opinion polls suggested a consolidation of both organs of power by the far right. While Civic Coalition remains marginally ahead, its vote share would not be enough to get it over the line. </p>

<p>Two parties even more extreme than PiS would – if the numbers were reflected on election day – be likely to determine the outcome. One is called Confederation. When it first ran in the 2019 European Parliament elections, one of its leaders, Sławomir Mentzen, declared: “We don’t want Jews, homosexuals, abortion, taxes and the European Union.” He has since tried to distance himself from that statement, a little.</p>

<p>The other grouping is even more off the scale. It is called the Crown and is the personal fiefdom of Grzegorz Braun, who in December 2023 while an MP doused a menorah candle with a fire extinguisher during the annual marking of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Parliament, the Sejm, stripped him of his immunity and he is currently facing trial. </p>

<p>During his first court appearance, he said his action fell firmly within his parliamentary remit. He was still allowed to stand in the presidential elections last May, where the combined vote in the first round for Mentzen and Braun was almost 21%. Polls suggest those numbers have since risen further.</p>

<p>For Trump, such an outcome – a PiS president and prime minister, aided and abetted by conspiracy theorists – would overnight turn Poland into one of his closest allies. It would leapfrog the role of EU-saboteur currently played by Hungary, whose longstanding prime minister, Viktor Orbán, faces a possible defeat in elections in April (unless he manages to fiddle the vote). Orbán is regarded with affection in MAGA circles, but is increasingly seen as beyond his sell-by date.</p>

<p>Both sides know that Nawrocki must keep a certain performative distance from the White House. In a country whose identity is tied with notions of sovereignty, being seen as a Trump whisperer has its downsides.</p>

<p>Tusk presents himself as the last stand for liberal democracy. In echoes of Keir Starmer, he trims and he discards anything that might seem controversial. He also seeks to appropriate some of the positions of the populists, not least on immigration and issues of identity. </p>

<p>As a result, relations with Germany have deteriorated. The previous PiS government put reparations for damage caused by the Nazis’ occupation of Poland at the heart of foreign and European policy. Amid increasingly bellicose rhetoric, it commissioned a report that in 2022 calculated the compensation owed at €1.5tn.</p>

<p>Even though it was more than three times the size of Germany’s actual budget, the former government minister who led the work described it as “conservative”. The issue has continued to rumble into Tusk’s administration, with successive governments in Berlin insisting that the issue has long been legally closed. </p>

<p>All of this presents a dilemma for Friedrich Merz, who pledged to put Poland at the heart of his Europe policy, keeping an electoral promise to visit both Paris and Warsaw on the same day straight after his appointment last May.</p>

<p>The mood soured quickly, however, when Merz’s new government announced within weeks of taking office that it was introducing checks on all its borders, including Poland, and would send back any migrant who had arrived from neighbouring countries. Immediately the Polish far right sent self-declared “citizen patrols” to the Polish side of the border in a bid to stop them coming over. </p>

<p>Even though the actual numbers were smaller than they had been before, the optics were terrible. As the pressure on Tusk grew, he was forced to exclaim that “Poland’s patience is running out”. His government introduced tit-for-tat checks on its own side of the frontier, and while they have since been pared back on both sides, the bad feeling on the issue has lingered. </p>

<p>Tusk is hedging his bets, seeking stronger relations with Paris in an EU context and with London. Yet even here he has received setbacks, with Poland feeling shut out from important Ukraine meetings by the E3 (Germany, France and the UK).</p>

<p>In the mayhem of now, autumn 2027 feels a long way away. On the surface, Warsaw and the main cities seem to be thriving. Yet behind the scenes, some are wondering nervously about their fate. They have seen the difference between Trump I and Trump II, and they fear that a far right government holding all levers would be unrecognisable to anything that has come before. </p>

<p>One woman who had worked in central government, and has now taken a quieter job in a mayoralty, told me that when she left, she was hounded. “They not only kick you out, they also pursue you with lawyers on fabricated charges. I had to pay for my own.” She was fully exonerated, and her MAGA-style accusers eventually disappeared, but she received no apology. </p>

<p>Some of her friends have chosen to stay away from government, for fear of what might await them. That is the grim scenario. But there is another, one of thriving start-ups, young creatives and internationally engaged citizens. Its fate hangs in the balance, but on this occasion, Poland alone will be responsible for the outcome. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[Has the secretary for Homeland Security been distracted by her close relationship with advisor Corey Lewandowski and a missing blanket?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The normally high-minded <em>Wall Street Journal</em> normally leaves gossip and tittle-tattle to America’s downmarker supermarket magazines – but might one piece of eye-popping reportage this week explain why the Department of Homeland Security has taken its eye off the ball of late?</p>

<p>Under the headline “A pilot fired over Kristi Noem’s missing blanket and the constant chaos inside DHS”, an in-depth piece by three <em>Journal</em> reporters (just one fewer than it took to uncover Watergate) suggests that a closer-than-usual relationship between secretary Kristi Noem and her top adviser Corey Lewandowski has been at the heart of the department’s disarray.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“Noem and Lewandowski’s close relationship had already made Trump and his top advisers uncomfortable,” the paper reports, adding that: “Lewandowski had initially wanted to formally serve as Noem’s chief of staff, but Trump rejected the idea due to reports of a romantic relationship between the two – which he has continued to bring up, officials say”.</p>

<p>It reports how, after photos of Lewandowski showed him going back and forth between his apartment and Noem’s across the street last year, Noam moved into a government-owned waterfront house on a military base in Washington that is provided to the leader of the US Coast Guard. “Lewandowski also spends time at the house,” it mischievously adds.</p>

<p>“Lewandowski and Noem, who are both married, have publicly denied the reports of the affair, but people said they do little to hide their relationship inside the department,” the Journal goes on. “The DHS spokeswoman said the department ‘doesn’t waste time with salacious, baseless gossip’.”</p>

<p>The “missing blanket” in the headline refers to a bizarre alleged incident in which Lewandowski fired a US Coast Guard pilot after Noam accidentally left a blanket behind on a plane. The pilot was initially fired and told to take a commercial flight home when Noam and Lewandowski reached their destination, but was eventually reinstated “because no one else was available to fly them home”. </p>

<p>A DHS spokeswoman did not address the episode but said Noam had “made personnel decisions to deliver excellence”.</p>

<p>In other Kristi Noem sanity news, the <em>WSJ</em> reported that the secretary closely monitored how her national profile compared with other administration officials, particularly White House border czar Tom Homan, who Trump has just put in charge of ICE operations in Minnesota.</p>

<p>“Noem routinely berated staff if she saw Homan on TV and kept track of both their appearances to make sure she was on TV more than him, according to people familiar with the matter,” the <em>Journal</em> reported.</p>

<p>All fun and games at the DHS, then! Meanwhile, two completely innocent civilians remain dead after being shot in cold blood by ICE agents under Noem and Lewandowski’s leadership.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Reform’s debut season in local government continues to go about as well as might have been expected. The competition among Reform-run local authorities to lose the most councillors is hotting up!</p>

<p>Currently in first place is Kent, Reform’s flagship English council, which has so far lost nine of its 57 councillors elected just last May to expulsions, suspensions and defections.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>But hot on its heels is Durham, where the council’s deputy leader, former GB News man Darren Grimes, is currently embroiled in a row over leaders’ “belittling behaviour”. The Durham authority has now lost six councillors since last May’s elections.</p>

<p>Most recent to quit is Nick Brown, who resigned on Thursday afternoon saying its leaders “hold members of their own administration in very serious disdain”. He wrote in his resignation letter: “I have no doubt that Nigel and all of you would argue that loyalty is essential in a political party but I would reply that loyalty must be earned.</p>

<p>“I have spoken with a lot more people I would describe as ‘core Reform voters’ and every single one of them sees no change”.</p>

<p>It comes as a freedom of information request released to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> showed that the council had spent £18,297 dealing with complaints against Reform councillors in the past nine months, many of them against Grimes, the most public face of the council. Brown said he had filed a formal complaint over bullying against Grimes a week before he resigned.</p>

<p>The <em>Telegraph</em> quoted John Shuttleworth (an independent member of Durham Council, not the versatile singer-songwriter from Sheffield, South Yorkshire) as saying: “I’m not surprised by it. I’ve never seen such horrible, aggressive and nasty behaviour in my 29 years of being a councillor.”</p>

<p>For his part, Grimes has said: “Reform UK was elected to clean up Durham county council, not to maintain the status quo. Change of this scale naturally attracts resistance from those who benefited from the old, failing system.</p>

<p>“Regarding councillor Nick Brown, the party maintains the highest standards of performance. Where those standards are not met, a ‘spring clean’ is both necessary and inevitable to ensure our residents receive the representation they deserve.” What a charmer!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, over in Kent, where Reform came to power last year vowing to cut council tax… the council this week announced a 3.99% increase, one percentage point below the limit at which a referendum is required.</p>

<p>“History has been made today at Kent County Council,” cheered leader Linden Kemkaran on X. “Reform has passed a balanced budget and a council tax rise of just 3.99%. Well done team Reform,” she added, with a heart emoji. Does she think Kent residents have the memory of a goldfish?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Where in the world is James Cleverly?</p>

<p>The former home and foreign secretary and one-time Tory leadership hopeful was brought back on to the Conservative frontbench as shadow housing secretary by Kemi Badenoch last summer, with her saying it was “an opportunity to bring back a very very talented colleague”.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“It’s about bringing back experience,” said Badenoch at the time. “James is a former foreign and home secretary, former party chairman and he has a lot more experience than anyone on Labour’s front bench.” That was seven months ago. Has anyone seen him since? </p>

<p>By Rats in a Sack’s back-of-a-fag-packet calculations, since being appointed Cleverly – long seen as one of the Conservatives’ few competent media communicators – has done just five weekday morning broadcast rounds (including one on his first full day back in the shadow cabinet), one Sunday broadcast round, one <em>Question Time</em> and one <em>Peston</em>, as well as a shift filling Nick Ferrari’s ample seat on his LBC show.</p>

<p>Wherever can he be? The most generous of the possible reasons for Cleverly’s invisibility Rats has heard is that Cleverly was appointed specifically to shadow Angela Rayner, one of Labour’s best communicators. Now Rayner is – for the time being – gone, and the housing portfolio is held by the largely unknown Steve Reed, Cleverly is needed less, although as a pugnacious all-round performer, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>The second possible reason is that Cleverly’s ambitions lie elsewhere. The Conservatives have yet to name their candidate for the next London mayoral election in 2028 and last October Cleverly said: “I’d be stupid not to think about it”.</p>

<p>But the third and most persistent rumour is that Cleverly remains at odds with Badenoch over the policy that she has put front and centre of her leadership: a commitment to leaving the European Court of Human Rights. Cleverly was opposed to leaving the ECHR during the 2024 leadership contest, and on his return to the frontbench last year still didn’t sound all that enthusiastic about leaving.</p>

<p>During his leadership campaign, Cleverly said his party needed to be “more normal” and before his appointment last year warned the Conservatives against copying Reform UK’s policies. How’s that going? </p>

<p>Last month, when Andy Street, the former West Midlands mayor, and Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, launched a new group within the party for centrist and centre-right voters, Badenoch told them to “get out of the way” and boasted that “my Conservative party has moved to the right every day since I became leader”. No wonder Cleverly’s gone AWOL!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Conservative peer joked about Keir Starmer knighting Jimmy Savile - something actually done following pressure from his heroine Margaret Thatcher]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Arch-Brexiteer Conservative Dan Hannan really, really loves Margaret Thatcher. He frequently invokes her in his <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Conservative Home</em> columns, has spoken of his “clear memory” of her 1979 election victory (when he was seven years old) and a large picture of his heroine still adorns the top of his X account.</p>

<p>It was on that very X account this week that Hannan, who considers himself something of a wit, decided to treat his followers to what he thought was a hilarious joke in response to the Peter Mandelson and Matthew Doyle scandals.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“‘Look here, Jimmy [Saville], these awful stories about you. They’re not true are they?’,” he posted.</p>

<p>“‘Now then, now then, Sir Keir, don’t believe everything you read.’”</p>

<p>“Good! Thanks for being so honest! Ambassadorship or peerage?’”</p>

<p>Apart from Hannan being highly unlikely to get a booking for <em>Mock The Week</em> anytime soon, he seems to have had a curious memory lapse for someone who so vividly recalls an election that took place when he was seven.</p>

<p>For it was of course Savile’s close friend Margaret Thatcher, not Keir Starmer, who lobbied hard for the TV presenter to be knighted, despite senior civil servants repeatedly warning her about the risks. </p>

<p>Documents released in 2013 showed how, in 1983, mandarins rebuffed her requests, citing Savile’s “manner of life” and fears he might exploit the honour. Sir Robert Armstrong, the most senior civil servant in the country at the time and chair of the honours committee, vetoed the idea, saying it was too soon after “unfortunate revelations” in which the entertainer had boasted to the press of having sex with women he met while running charity marathons.</p>

<p>Thatcher raised the matter again just months later but Sir Robert said “lurid details” were unlikely to have been forgotten and it “would be best if Mr Savile were to wait a little longer”.</p>

<p>After further requests were also turned down, Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks wrote to Sir Robert in 1986 saying that she was “most disappointed that Mr Savile’s name has not been recommended”. He added: “She wonders how many more times his name is to be pushed aside, especially in view of all the great work he had done for Stoke Mandeville [hospital].” </p>

<p>Savile would later be found to have abused 63 people connected to Stoke Mandeville Hospital.</p>

<p>Thatcher finally got her way when Savile was eventually knighted in 1990 – although, in Hannan’s recalling of events, this was nothing to do with his heroine and all down to a then little-known 27-year-old legal officer for the campaign group Liberty, Keir Starmer!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Dan Thomas, Nigel Farage's new man in Wales, has hit out after claims he didn't actually live there]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>If you’re the new leader of Reform of Wales, pitching yourself as a salt-of-the-earth Valleys boy taking on the elites, you probably don’t want to be publicly whingeing about the media “weaponising” your “property portfolio” against you. Yet that’s precisely what Dan Thomas has found himself doing just a week into being parachuted into the role.</p>

<p>Thomas, a long-serving Conservative councillor in North London, was named the new leader of Reform in Wales by Nigel Farage last week, ahead of much more established candidates. Thomas had not lived in Wales for 20 years and only defected from the Tories last year.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>This set the website <em>Nation.Cymru</em> sniffing around where Thomas actually lived. All candidates to the Senedd have to have their primary residence in Wales – a rule change brought in after members of Farage’s previous parties chose to commute over the border (Neil Hamilton, disgraced former Tory minister turned Welsh Ukip leader, spent his entire five years in the Senedd travelling in from his Wiltshire mansion).</p>

<p><em>Nation.Cymru</em> reported that Thomas was living in Bath, where he had recently bought a £1m home, having sold his previous home in West London. It quoted a former colleague of his on Barnet Council, Peter Zinkin, who said: “Our understanding is that he sold his house in Edgware and moved to the Bath area, where he is working for a large financial institution.”</p>

<p>Blaenau Gwent Labour MS Alun Davies told the website: “The last time this shower had seats in the Senedd, when they stood as Ukip, they were led by Neil Hamilton, who lived in a mansion in Wiltshire. This time their leader lives 10 miles nearer to Wales. At this rate they will have a leader who actually lives in Wales by 2050.”</p>

<p>Now, after much to-ing and fro-ing, Thomas has insisted that he isn’t living in Bath, but <em>has</em> bought a house there which he is renting out. He told BBC Wales in a heart-breaking interview: “Look, I have a property portfolio. I’m not going to talk about locations of properties and all of that kind of thing, but that is being weaponised against me to try and make out that I’m not living in Wales, I’ve been ‘parachuted in’, it’s nonsense.”</p>

<p>Of course, Thomas <em>was</em> parachuted in – as ever with Reform, there was no pretence of internal democracy – but at least he’s put the record straight. A bit, anyway: Reform won’t say where he is living beyond “in Wales”, apparently for security reasons. Wales is more than 8,000 square miles in size.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The British honours system used to look silly. Now it looks rotten.</p>

<p>Lord Mandelson will be stripped of his peerage. Lord Doyle could follow. But then, Michelle Mone is still officially a Baroness and Jeffrey Archer a Lord.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Norman Bettison is still a Sir, despite an Independent Office for Police Conduct report released last December that found he, along with 11 other retired police officers, would have faced gross misconduct proceedings under today’s laws over the Hillsborough disaster. Philip Green remains a knight despite his conduct during the collapse of BHS and his attempt last year to use the European Court of Human Rights to put new controls on free speech in Parliament.</p>

<p>Doubtless Jim Ratcliffe, toxic boss of chemical company Ineos and co-owner of Manchester United, will keep his own knighthood despite racist remarks made in a Sky News interview on Wednesday. “The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn’t it?” said the man whose team’s 33-man squad features 20 non-British players.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe added: “the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it’s 70 million.” In fact, the population of the UK in 2020 was 67 million, but Ratcliffe did not acknowledge the error in his pathetic non-apology apology (“I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.”)</p>

<p>If any more evidence was needed that Jim Ratcliffe was wrong, Nigel Farage then popped up to declare: “Jim Ratcliffe is right”. This gruesome twosome were on the same side in the Brexit wars, where Ratcliffe was one of a handful of business leaders to back leaving the EU.</p>

<p>Knighted two years later, once Britain was on the brink of formally Brexiting he showed his love of country and belief in the sunlit uplands to come by officially changing his tax domicile from Hampshire to Monaco, thus saving himself £4bn in tax.</p>

<p>Another great British Brexiteer patriot is John Redwood, the veteran Eurosceptic who in 2017, with the referendum won, wrote a financial advice column for the <em>FT</em> in which he recommended that investors should withdraw their money from the UK and invest in the EU instead. The article was headlined “Look further afield as the UK hits brakes”. That’s hardly “Country! Country! O but my heart is with you!”, as the Welsh national anthem so beautifully puts it.</p>

<p>Now Redwood has been rewarded for this remarkable display of loyalty to the flag by becoming Baron Redwood of Wokingham. Having taken his place in the House of Lords on Tuesday, he will now be able to hob-nob in ermine with the likes of Evgeny Lebedev and Ian Botham (if they ever turn up). He can join the lucky band of peers who get to listen to Claire Fox’s electric speeches close-up (I’ve no argument with that peerage; at least it keeps her off the radio).</p>

<p>Yet given all Redwood’s rage about the European Parliament, surely it can only be a matter of time before this principled figure starts ripping up the red upholstery of his new surroundings in protest at being trapped in an unelected, expensive chamber?</p>

<p>If Ratcliffe and Redwood are what Britain now chooses to honour, the best thing would be to stop calling them honours at all. Just scrap the lot.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[An extraordinary tech surge is underway. At its core are female founders solving the untouchable problems]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>There’s a particular kind of concentration in Lahore’s co-working spaces – quiet, deliberate, almost stubborn – that feels worlds away from Silicon Valley’s noise and self-mythology. In shared offices across Johar Town, Gulberg and beyond, Pakistani women are building startups around problems that rarely make it onto billion-pound pitch decks: children with food allergies who can’t find safe products, stay-at-home mothers locked out of digital skills, domestic violence survivors navigating the legal system alone.</p>

<p>These are not the kind of “disruptions” that excite venture capitalists hunting the next unicorn. They are the prosaic mechanics of daily life. Yet solving them may prove just as transformative for Pakistan’s economic future.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Because Pakistan’s tech ecosystem is growing – rapidly.</p>

<p>According to Dealroom, the specialist global tech data firm, Pakistan’s startup scene has expanded 3.6 times since 2020, outpacing India and New York. There are now 170 venture-backed startups with a combined valuation of more than £4bn.</p>

<p>For startups launched since 2015, the sector has grown 11.3 times in five years, a rate that rivals the Bay Area at its peak. It mirrors where India’s ecosystem stood roughly a decade ago. Today, India’s tech sector is worth around £700bn and, as it hosts Google’s Sundar Pichai, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and others at this week’s AI Impact Summit, offers a glimpse of where its neighbour could be heading.</p>

<p>At the centre of Pakistan’s surge is a cohort often overlooked: women.</p>

<p>Of the 3,400 applications to last year’s Aurora Tech Award – a global prize for female founders – 288 came from Pakistan. That is 8.5% of the global total from a country with less than 3% of the world’s population.</p>

<p>And these founders are building differently.</p>

<p>While much of Europe and the US chases AI tools, consumer tech and fintech apps, Pakistani women are working across education, health and infrastructure. Maria Ameer’s Ootien produces Pakistan’s first certified allergen-free foods, born from her own coeliac diagnosis. </p>

<p>Anusha Shahid’s Zvolta converts business premises into EV charging stations. Saba Nisar’s Saheli uses AI to monitor reproductive health. These are companies shaped less by abstract market modelling and more by lived necessity.</p>

<p>The challenge is capital.</p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2021, Pakistani startups collectively raised around £500m. For context, US startups raised roughly £300bn in 2021 alone. Of Pakistan’s total, just 1.4% went to women-led ventures. By 2025, that share had risen to around 10% of the ecosystem. Progress, perhaps, but still far from parity.</p>

<p>The imbalance is global, but in emerging markets it compounds. Female founders face the structural biases of venture capital while operating in an environment where capital itself is scarce.</p>

<p>Yet scarcity has prompted ingenuity.</p>

<p>Shut out of traditional VC pipelines, women are building parallel infrastructure. Standard Chartered’s Women in Tech programme grew from 86 applicants in 2019 to 1,900 across more than 100 cities by 2025. Companies like inDrive – now the number one ride-hailing service in Pakistan – are investing not only money but operational support.</p>

<p>The ten finalists in this year’s Women in Tech cohort – Ameer’s Ootien among them – generated Rs25 million in verified revenue within two months. They are tracking growth of 3.3 times. By western standards, where fivefold first-year growth is the benchmark for breakout startups, that may look modest. But these are companies that began with women solving the problems they encounter every day.</p>

<p>Walk through Lahore’s emerging tech hubs and you’ll see the signs: multiplying co-working spaces, cafés filled with laptop-clutching twenty-somethings, a young population betting that technology offers an exit from stagnation. Among them, increasingly, are women reframing Pakistan’s challenges – in education, healthcare, access to services – as opportunity.</p>

<p>Whether that optimism translates into durable, scalable businesses will depend less on ambition than on whether capital is willing to meet it. Talent is there. Demand is there. The pipeline is filling. The quiet disruptors are building.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Jack Thorne has followed Adolescence with another triumphant and troubling piece of work]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Jack Thorne was the co-writer of <em>Adolescence</em>, the Netflix sensation that alerted millions of parents to the brutal reality of what their sons and daughters were doing on their phones. Now he has adapted <em>Lord of the Flies</em> for the BBC. We are back in the early 1950s. A plane has crashed on an island somewhere in the tropics, with no adult survivors. Mobile phones have not been invented, and the families and schools that kept the boys in check are gone. They are left to their own devices. </p>

<p>We know what William Golding made his boys do. What will Thorne show us about them?</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The power of <em>Adolescence</em> was to show us that vulnerability and savagery could not just co-exist but feed off each other in a cycle of fear and revenge. Jamie wanted to act like a man but didn’t know how. Jamie killed a girl. When a female psychologist tried to get him to explain why, he lashed out at her. </p>

<p>There are no girls in <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, of course, just a suitcase belonging to a female flight attendant who disappeared in the crash. One of the boys puts on her petticoat and struts about. The self-appointed leader of the hunters, Jack, observes witheringly that her bra might make a bag for carrying things. He wears a fox-fur as a sort of waistcoat. Jack finds his fellow pupil Simon’s diary and steals it.</p>

<p>This version tells us a lot more about the boys’ history than Golding did – the death of a mother, a choirboy crush. And Thorne shows us how the boys’ memory of their fathers hovers over them, for good or bad. They are proud of them, fear them, despise them, and without them they look to each other for validation. </p>

<p>Piggy’s parents are dead. He is the one who tells stories to the little ‘uns to get them off to sleep.</p>

<p>In the book, Piggy is killed outright by a rock (“His head opened and stuff came out and turned red,” wrote Golding, in the awful, spare language of a child) and washed away by the sea. Thorne has him staggering wounded through the forest with Ralph, who risks his life to fetch him water. Realising he is dying, he soothes him to sleep; and rather than abandoning the body, he buries him. </p>

<p>In earlier flashbacks, we watched him turning down a hunting expedition with his father, preferring to stay with his dying mother. These scenes between Piggy (David McKenna) and Ralph (Winston Sawyers) are almost unbearably tender. </p>

<p>Both are extraordinary, as is Lox Pratt who, although there is much of the Draco Malfoy about him – he plays the role in the forthcoming <em>Harry Potter</em> adaptation – conveys Jack’s pathetic need to prove himself, even as he makes you understand why the rest of the boys decide to ditch Ralph and join his ‘tribe’.</p>

<p>But it is Ike Talbut who is the revelation. In the book, Simon is the uneasy conscience of the island, but Golding gives him very little space to speak. In this version, Jack, Piggy, Ralph and Simon each have an episode following them around the island. It is his first role, and Talbut is astonishingly expressive. Among several gifted young actors, it is his face that holds you. </p>

<p>It is the sight of a boy on the cusp of adolescence trying to understand how Jack, the boy whose company he used to crave, turned from choirboy to killer. In a strange, intimate scene, he smears mud on Jack’s face to prepare him for the pig hunt.</p>

<p>Thorne never labours it, but with time, Golding’s story has taken on a resonance it probably lacked in 1954. When they are finally rescued, Ralph confesses to the Royal Navy officer that two of the boys have been killed.</p>

<p>“I should have thought that a pack of British boys – you’re all British aren’t you? – would have been able to put up a better show than that,” he says. It was a silly thing to say then, and now it evokes an era when we did believe that British people landing on tropical islands would both civilise the inhabitants and make men out of the colonisers. </p>

<p>Much of the series was filmed in Malaysia, which Britain only gave up in the late 1950s. It makes you feel the beauty and the horror of the island, and the sense of things – fire, water, flies – mercilessly consuming other things.</p>

<p><em>Lord of the Flies</em> is a triumphant piece of work. It is gently optimistic where the original despaired: Ralph emerges with dignity, and Jack’s expression when he sees the naval officer is the mingled disappointment and relief of a boy who realises, suddenly, where his fantasies have taken him. </p>

<p>Most of all, just like <em>Adolescence</em>, it warns us not to abandon boys to their own worlds. They need us.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Chronovisor, Bowels of Hell and Variations on a Theme stand out at the Rotterdam Film Festival]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>It’s not easy being the Rotterdam Film Festival, but I’m glad it exists. The Dutch festival is always going to find it hard to compete with Berlin and Cannes, its closest rivals on the calendar.</p>

<p>Rotterdam runs from late January to early February, but it’s Berlin, which happens just after, that is seen as kicking off the film festival season for the year. And the Germans probably feel similarly uncomfortable in regard to Cannes – not helped by the way they have recently cycled through festival directors and been prey to political controversy when it comes to the stance they’ve taken on Gaza. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>I’ve been going to the International Rotterdam Film Festival for the last three years. It offers a good catch-up for films I’ve not seen at other festivals in its Limelight section, as well as some great picks in its main programme. </p>

<p>During the opening ceremony this year, festival director Vanja Kaludjercic explicitly championed cinema as an antidote to the pile-up of crises which we are experiencing and, I would argue, we have been experiencing for roughly a decade: Brexit, the Trump presidencies, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the October 7 massacre and the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. </p>

<p>Vanja might not have mentioned all of these, but that was the gist. Cinema helps us collaborate and understand a world which is increasingly fractured and isolated.  </p>

<p>I’m never sure about this kind of pro-cinema propaganda. It comes from the world and is part of the world which is criticised. We can have anti-racist films, and racist films: sometimes the same film can be both: see <em>Green Book</em> (2018). And many films pass through the consciousness like neutrinos, leaving no trace whatsoever. </p>

<p>The opening film, for instance, <em>Providence and the Guitar</em> is the kind of pleasant enough arthouse fare which will meander through festivals without ever disturbing the wider culture. In a sense the film itself is about art for art’s sake as actor and playwright couple León (Pedro Inês) and Elvira (Clara Riedenstein), sojourn in a 19th-century Portuguese village and struggle to get paid for their elaborate shows. </p>

<p>Joåo Nicolau’s film is about believing in yourself even if you’re not very good and features a flash-forward to present day Lisbon in which a punk band is about to break up. It’s affable, but – like so many films in the festival circuit – is way too long.</p>

<p>But, as Bing Crosby once sang: I’m going to accentuate the positive. IFFR screened 428 features and shorts in its ten-day run. Between trips to a fantastic ramen restaurant and shivering in the freezing weather, I had the pleasure of visiting the wonderful Cinerama and Kino cinemas, as well as the IMAX multiplex. </p>

<p>I greatly enjoyed <em>Chronovisor</em>, directed by Kevin Walker and Jack Auen. A strange tale, inspired by the work of Jorge Louis Borges and Umberto Eco, it follows the investigations of an archivist into a machine which allows viewers to see into the past. </p>

<p>Most of the film is taken up with reading texts from magazines and books, gossip rags, academic treatises, all of which are highlighted on the screen as we build up an eerie sense of <em>foreboding </em>as the Vatican and various shady characters get involved, all to the sound of Holst’s Planets, well Planet (Saturn), on the soundtrack. It’s like looking over Morgan Freeman’s shoulder as he researches the seven deadly sins in <em>Se7en</em>, but then the last act pays off splendidly. </p>

<p>A more in-your-face (or up your bum) genre piece came with <em>Bowels of Hell</em>, a Brazilian horror comedy about a demonic toilet directed by Gustavo Vinagre and Gurcius Gewdner, which is shitty but in a good way. More John Waters than Brian Yuzna, the filmmakers pull off quite the trick by actually having quite a lot to say about gender identity and grief while still delivering on plop jokes and gross-out deaths. </p>

<p>Ivo M. Ferreira’s Portuguese retrothriller <em>Projecto Global </em>portrays the terrorist activities of a far left group in the 1980s. Believing the 1975 Carnation Revolution to have failed, Rosa (Jani Zhao) and her FP-25 group of radicals set about bombing, assassinating and robbing banks to fund their activities. </p>

<p>The film stands as something of a corrective to the overly rosy view of left wing violence propagated by Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>One Battle After Another</em>. There’s plenty of revolutionary chic here, a great soundtrack, and all those period trappings of heavy telephone and constant smoking, but ultimately this is a film about the self-lacerating nature of political violence that has become disconnected from the people it purports to be helping. </p>

<p>The film which claimed the top prize was <em>Variations on a Theme</em>, a surprisingly modest South African drama about an 80-year-old goat farmer Hettie, caught out by a scam that promises to pay her compensation for her father’s war service – he fought in the second world war and was paid off with a bicycle and a pair of leather boots.</p>

<p>It’s one of those films that is determinedly local, seeing in the corner of the world a bend on the road to nowhere, the whole universe and all its drama. Writer/director team Jason Jacobs and Devon Delmar delve into the dreams and disappointments of the community, gaining an intimacy via Jacobs’ voiceover, which seems to have access to the innermost thoughts of the villagers.</p>

<p><em><strong>The 55th International Film Festival of Rotterdam ran from 29 January to 8 February, 2026. </strong></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>There’s a theme that Sir Tom Stoppard explores in Arcadia – how everything in life begins by being warm and ends up cold and there is no reversing that process – and of course it seems all the more poignant coming so soon after the great playwright’s death. </p>

<p>The first thing to be said about Carrie Cracknell’s production is that it is stylishly done. There is great set and lighting design from respectively Alex Eales and Guy Hoare and impressive costumes from Suzanne Cave. The acting is also high-definition and in its own way rather old-fashioned, with a real emphasis on the actors communicating Stoppard’s <em>bon mots</em> clearly and audibly. </p>

<p>This of course matters as Cracknell appreciates that Stoppard’s plays are always primarily about dazzling wordplay and this one is no exception. Seamus Dillane stands out in the ensemble as the tutor who makes the mistake of educating his pupil – played with beguiling innocence by Isis Hainsworth – and this young actor has that indefinable quality that has nothing whatsoever to do with good looks that draws the eyes of audiences upon him. </p>

<p>Tim Frances has less of an opportunity to shine as a lugubrious butler but nevertheless makes the most of every second he is on stage and achieved some of the biggest first night laughs. </p>

<p>This is an elegant, attractive, entertaining production and it is quintessentially Stoppardian in that the words make you think a lot about life and its ironies, but they are always the masters rather than the servants of the plot. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[When Man United’s co-owner talks about being "colonised by immigrants”, does he mean Monaco?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>I am sorry to have to admit it but Sir Jim Ratcliffe is right. His country has been “colonised by immigrants”, they have flooded the country and make virtually no contribution to its society.</p>

<p>But enough about Monaco, where Sir Jim has been living for years now as an immigrant. Where he moved to save billions in tax, and which like so much of the population there he uses as a public convenience.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>He is the walking advert for my plan to strip honours off anyone who leaves the UK for tax purposes. He is also an advert for the kind of people who supported Leave and presumably still support Reform. </p>

<p>Ratcliffe told Sky News: “You can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn’t it?</p>

<p>“I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it’s 70 million. That’s 12 million people.”</p>

<p>His figures are totally wrong. In 2020, the population of the UK was 67 million. He is miles out, and he doesn’t care. </p>

<p>Ratcliffe also worries that too many people are on benefits, forgetting that most of them are in work, rather like the head of Tesco who complained about the same thing recently. The answer is obviously to introduce a living wage, not a minimum wage, then cut all benefits for those in work.</p>

<p>How do you feel about that, Sir Jim? No, I didn’t think so.</p>

<p>Sir Jim is obviously a proud citizen of Monaco and if he could limit himself to criticising its economic model, lazy citizens and law and order problems – oh, and of course the flood of immigrants that have changed its society beyond recognition and colonised it in a few short years – we might want to listen.</p>

<p>In fact, now we know what he really thinks, maybe it is time to look at the law that allows such tax refugees to visit the UK so often and for so long. He obviously doesn’t want or need to be here.</p>

<p>I am sure there is a bar somewhere in Monaco that shows Man United matches on a big screen. If there isn’t, with £17 billion in his bank account, tax free, I am sure he can afford to set one up.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Saltburn director ropes in Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi to give a bleak classic the Bridgerton treatment]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>In 1847, a young woman living in an isolated house in the middle of Yorkshire published a beautiful love story – one of the greatest love stories of all time. It would not only be adapted many times for the stage, cinema and television but would serve as a template for a thousand books and films to come. The name of the woman was Charlotte Bronte and that book was <em>Jane Eyre</em>. </p>

<p>The same year her sister Emily published her own novel, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, which could’ve been subtitled, via Johnny Lydon, “This is not a love song.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Charlotte’s book provided a template for the modern love story. A marginalised woman takes on a professional role in a hostile environment and comes into contact with a handsome, charismatic male in a position of authority who negs her but is also irresistibly drawn to her. Yet there’s an obstacle in the way (the madwoman in the attic, his actual wife, Bertha Mason). </p>

<p>The woman finds an alternative suitor who would provide a conventionally acceptable pairing, but doesn’t get her moist. Returning to her true love, she finds the obstacle has gone – burned down the house and herself in it – and the man has been humbled and now needs her. The choice between the head and the heart, self-sacrifice and being true to one’s self are played out in a dramatically windswept landscape with pathetic fallacy forecast for the weekend: rainy for funerals, lightning for passion.  </p>

<p>Where Charlotte wedded the Jane Austen marriage novel to the rural gothic, Emily’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is a full-throated hate story and entirely a unique beast. Even the declaration of love in it makes this clear: Catherine Earnshaw says, “I am Heathcliff, not “I love Heathcliff.” </p>

<p>The book’s central relationship is a toxic mess of narcissism, incest and jealousy. Passionate, yes, but as Morgan Freeman says in <em>Se7en </em>while looking at blood splatter in a crime scene: “Just look at all that passion on that wall.” </p>

<p>Now here comes Emerald Fennell’s disappointing new film version of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, with Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi playing Catherine and Heathcliff. Fennell has said most of all she wanted the film to give viewers the feeling she had when she first read the book as a 14-year-old, which is a weird admission to make, but okay. So what we get is horny, empty, immature fun. </p>

<p>And, like some 14-year-olds, Fennell skips the ending. </p>

<p>One of the reasons the book is so hard to adapt is that “heroine” Cathy dies roughly halfway through the book. The rest of the novel is taken up with Heathcliff’s intergenerational revenge. Talk about trauma. </p>

<p>William Wyler’s version from 1939, starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, snipped off the second half of the book, as did the 1970 Robert Fuest adaptation starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall. Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes also starred in a truncated 1992 <em>Heights</em>.</p>

<p>Even when Andrea Arnold took the brave but perfectly valid decision – which Fennell reverses here – to cast a black actor, James Howson, as Heathcliff in 2011, she followed the pattern of leaving the story early. </p>

<p>I have no skin in the game with literary adaptation. A great novel (and I reread <em>Wuthering Heights</em> almost annually) will survive misunderstanding, and what makes a great novel doesn’t necessarily make a great movie. </p>

<p>But let’s be clear about what we’re losing. This isn’t just funning up a dusty text the way Baz Luhrmann does with <em>Romeo+Juliet </em>and <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. This is telling half the tale. Imagine a <em>Moby Dick</em> adaptation where they don’t find the whale, or a <em>Christmas Carol</em> where Scrooge is only visited by one and a half ghosts. </p>

<p>For Fennell, the problem with the second half of the book is that it fucks up the first. Our romantic hero, Heathcliff, who has already revealed himself as a domestic abuser, rapist and killer of pet dogs in the book, becomes a child abuser to boot. Now there’s a character arc. </p>

<p>In seeking his revenge on the world, he indulges in fraud, manipulation and there’s even a suggestion of necrophilia. I’m not sure if he has it off with Catherine’s corpse, but they definitely spoon. The hot and heavy passion of the first half has come to this morbidity. Heathcliff will manipulate the younger Catherine into an unhappy marriage to sickly Edgar, whom he encourages to beat her. </p>

<p>Fennell has her own vision, which turns out to involve vivid colours, bodice-ripping excess, Martin Clunes and a trademark hint of campy <em>Salburne</em>sque shock. Her film has drawn comparison not with the great love stories but with Mills &amp; Boon and <em>Carry On Dick</em> – possibly not what Fennell was aiming for, but who knows? </p>

<p>No doubt the smouldering glances, rain-soaked dresses and Elordi’s ecky-thump accent will sell out screens nationwide in time for Valentine’s Day, as well as providing memes galore. But it’s depressing to see how much safer than the original the film is. It cleans Heathcliff up, shaves off the hate and minimises his abuse into something more like mild BDSM of the <em>Fifty Shades </em>variety. </p>

<p>Essentially, what Fennell has done is give Bronte the <em>Bridgerton</em> treatment. And that’s fine – if you’re 14. For the rest of us, the chance to do something supernatural and not just superficial has been missed.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Reform's candidate in the Gorton &#038; Denton by-election pulled out of a hustings at 30 minutes' notice amid rumours he wanted his own green room]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Is the stress of the Gorton &amp; Denton by-election turning Matt Goodwin into a snowflake? On Tuesday night, the former academic turned hard right rabble rouser, Reform’s candidate in the forthcoming by-election, pulled out of a hustings event at 30 minutes’ notice, claiming to be concerned about the impartiality of its organiser.</p>

<p>The hustings was being hosted by Local Voices, a “collective of neighbours from across Gorton &amp; Denton who are unaffiliated with any political party”, according to its Instagram profile, and held at Gorton Methodist Church. A photo from the event shows seven of the 11 candidates for the by-election there – including those from Labour and the Greens – but not Reform’s Goodwin, who announced half an hour before that he would not be there.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“As you know, from my media contributions, I’ve never been one to shy away from a free and fair debate,” the GB News presenter posted on X.</p>

<p>“However, I have serious concerns about the impartiality of the hustings that have been organised for tonight. Previous statements by the organising group give the clear impression that a fair and level platform will not be provided for all candidates, so on that basis I will not be attending.”</p>

<p>It is not clear what the “previous statements by the organising group” are, its social media presence only detailing such dastardly left wing activities as organising a wassailing event with orchard blessings, mulled apple juice and “winter silliness”.</p>

<p>“I look forward to future opportunities to discuss the issues that matter most to those in the local area and answer questions from local residents in a genuinely neutral setting – including at the forthcoming <em>Manchester Evening News</em> hustings and the BBC’s by-election debate on Monday,” Goodwin went on. “I cannot wait for these debates.”</p>

<p>What was Goodwin’s issue? Organisers have suggested that he was insistent on having a separate green room, something which would tally with party colleague Zia Yusuf’s attitude (“I’ve been shocked at just how pally and cosy politicians from legacy parties are with each other in green rooms”), but maybe wasn’t possible in a small local church. </p>

<p>Andrew Western, Labour’s political lead on the campaign, meanwhile, has accused Goodwin of “attempting to pack the room with Reform supporters from outside the constituency, against the organisers’ wishes”. When this failed, say Labour, brave Goodwin ran away.</p>

<p>But it certainly contrasts with their attitude earlier this week to Bangor University, whose unaffiliated debating society turned down a request from Goodwin’s friend and colleague, MP Sarah Pochin, to speak at one of their events. Reform have said they will strip it of £30 million of funding, in effect shutting it down, if it wins the Senedd election in May. That would cost 2,000 jobs at the uni and would make a significant dent in the Bangor economy, which is currently boosted by the spending of 10,500 students.</p>

<p>It’s the latest in a string of bloopers by Reform in the constituency, who were confident of a win. This week Rats in a Sack reported how the party is facing a police investigation after sending out what appeared to be handwritten letters from a “concerned neighbour” that failed to state they had been written and distributed by Reform itself.</p>

<p>And Goodwin still hasn’t repudiated the endorsement of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the far right hooligan who has urged his supporters to back him, presumably lest it put off a few racists. Might he now be beginning to regret seeking the candidacy?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Nigel Farage has once again called on Britain to end the culture of working from home, telling 2,000 supporters at a rally in Birmingham that claims that staff are more productive at home are a “load of nonsense”.</p>

<p>Britain needed an “attitudinal change to the idea of working from home,” he told a crowd of supporters who had managed to procure time off work during the day. “People aren’t more productive working at home – it’s a load of nonsense. They’re more productive being with other fellow human beings and working as part of a team.”</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Ending WFH has long been a Farage hobby-horse, albeit something Reform has not always practised while preaching. Rats in a Sack has reported numerous times on jobs the party has advertised offering home working, including a role last year as regional director for the South Central region with a salary of £50,000 and the perk of “home working with occasional travel within the region”.</p>

<p>A similar advertisement for a regional director for Yorkshire and the Humber, salary £35-50,000, last summer offered “home working with occasional travel within the region”.</p>

<p>Why might Reform be so concerned about getting people back to the office? By a remarkable coincidence, deputy leader Richard Tice’s entry in the House of Commons’ Register of Members’ Interests shows he is a non-executive director of property investment firm Quidnet REIT Ltd and a major shareholder in another property investment firm, Tisun Investments Ltd.  Quident buys, refurbishes and leases out properties to businesses, including offices.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while Reform are keen to talk WFH, they’re less keen to chat KGB. Remarkably, not a single member of Farage’s party turned up to a Commons debate on Russian influence on UK politics and democracy on Monday, despite it being largely sparked by their own former leader in Wales’s jailing for taking bribes to give pro-Russian speeches.</p>

<p>Despite the debate taking two hours and 16 minutes, none of Reform’s eight MPs made it into Westminster Hall to hear Labour MP Ben Goldsborough talk about how “spouting pro-Russian talking points is not new for Reform politicians”.</p>

<p>“Nathan Gill’s boss, the honourable member for Clacton, blamed the EU and NATO for Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, said that the west had ‘provoked’ the invasion and described Putin as the world leader he most admired,” said Goldsborough. </p>

<p>“It seems that Reform politicians are comfortable doing the Kremlin’s dirty work for it, regardless of whether they get paid for the privilege. Maybe Russia should have asked Mr Gill to betray his country for free. It may as well have saved £40,000.”</p>

<p>Many other members spoke out about Reform, too, all under parliamentary privilege: if Farage’s MPs want to moan about what was said, they should have been there to respond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Another week, another week of triumphs and glory for Reform’s brave and loyal footsoldiers in local government!</p>

<p>There’s a by-election being held in <strong>Durham</strong>, the council deputy-led by former GB News man Darren Grimes, after Murton councillor David Cumming decided he was stepping down due to “overseas work commitments”.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Reform’s candidate for the seat is Theo Bell, who wants “to make sure that change is felt on the streets of Murton, not spent on more woke nonsense by Lib-Lab politicians. I’m a Murton lad, and I’m ready to get stuck in”.</p>

<p>The press release from Durham’s council leader, Andrew Husband, announcing Bell’s selection, lists the “people’s priorities” Reform had already delivered in power locally, including “Ending the Net-Zero Noose: We scrapped the performative ‘Climate Emergency’.” Which is awkward, as Bell’s own LinkedIn profile shows he is currently a salesman for Sunderland-based Honest Power, a, er, ‘Solar Electric Power Generation’ firm. Sounds a lot like the Net-Zero Noose!</p>

<p>Bell’s own statement says that “Murton has been treated like a safe seat for too long by people who either didn’t show up or didn’t care”. Surely he doesn’t mean his own potential predecessor Cumming, who lasted just seven months in the seat before heading for pastures new?</p>

<p>Down in <strong>Leicestershire</strong>, meanwhile, Reform’s council leader is trying to have the man who just last year he appointed as his deputy expelled from the party.</p>

<p>Last month Rats in a Sack reported how Joseph Boam, who briefly served as the council’s deputy leader last year before being sacked for being hopeless, marked the killing of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by posting a large ‘I STAND WITH ICE’ poster on his X account.</p>

<p>Rather than an obscure outlier, Boam is considered a rising star in Nigel Farage’s party despite being summarily sacked as Leicestershire’s deputy leader and lead member for adult social care positions after just three months last year when it emerged he wasn’t up to the job.</p>

<p>Now Dan Harrison, the leader who first appointed him, then gave him the heave-ho, has written to Reform high command to ask for him to be kicked out of the party entirely over his support for the trigger-happy MAGA militia. Harren has written to deputy leader Richard Tice urging him to “kick Joseph out of the party”.</p>

<p>In his letter to Tice, Harrison said 79 complaints had been made about Reform councillors since the party took power, of which fully 40 were lodged against Boam.</p>

<p>“What has been Joseph’s reaction?” Harrison said. “He blamed it all on the woke left wing, fake news or political smears. I was appalled at his lack of ownership of the problems he created.” The ICE post was “the final straw”, he said.</p>

<p>Boam is more relaxed, however. “I’m thought of quite highly by Reform HQ, so I don’t think there’s anything to worry about,” he has told the BBC.</p>

<p>Still, if Leicestershire needs a new Reform councillor, there’s an exciting new talent currently standing by a by-election to <strong>Leicester City Council</strong> following the death of the Labour incumbent in Stoneygate.</p>

<p>Michael Dabrowski’s manifesto, posted on his Facebook page, is “Its [sic] time to rebuild the city of leicester [sic] we need build [sic] the Communities [sic] of Leicester let [sic] make leicester [sic] great again lets [sic] start fixing the problems and stop wasting money”. Give that man the education portfolio immediately!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The media watchdog has declined to investigate a Donald Trump interview in which he was allowed to repeatedly spout unchallenged lies]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Earlier this year, Rats in a Sack asked “Could Ofcom finally take GB News to task?” after the media watchdog received numerous complaints about an interview it aired with Donald Trump late last year. The channel dispatched Beverly Turner to pitch him a series of less-than-penetrating questions in a rambling interview.</p>

<p>Ofcom was inundated with complaints about the unchallenged lies Trump repeatedly spouted during the interview, including asserting that man-made climate change was “a hoax”, that London had no-go areas for police and that the capital had “sharia law”.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>He made other claims about law and order and immigration that were either left unchallenged or effectively endorsed by Turner, a basketball presenter turned crackpot conspiracy theorist. When Trump said people are “being stabbed in the ass or worse”, she replied: “It’s true… It’s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].”</p>

<p>Now, after Ofcom officials are understood to have spent weeks examining 32 detailed complaints signed by tens of thousands of people, it has come to a decision: and nobody who has followed the toothless regulator’s attitude to the hard right broadcaster will be surprised.</p>

<p>The watchdog has declined to launch an investigation, saying that while Trump’s views “were not challenged during the interview itself”, “alternative perspectives” were set out in a surrounding panel discussion which did challenge his opinions.</p>

<p>“We carefully considered complaints about this current affairs programme which featured an interview with US President Donald Trump interspersed with a studio panel discussion and other guest interviews,” an Ofcom spokesperson said.</p>

<p>“Preserving due impartiality is a cornerstone of Ofcom’s broadcasting rules and we carried out a detailed assessment of the entire programme as broadcast. While we acknowledge that President Trump’s views were not challenged during the interview itself, the surrounding panel discussion and other guest interviews offered a range of alternative perspectives which strongly challenged his position.</p>

<p>“Given this, we will not be pursuing complaints about this programme further.”</p>

<p>Chris Banatvala, Ofcom’s founding director of standards, has said he was “astounded” by its decision.</p>

<p>“This was a test case for how Ofcom regulates broadcasters on due impartiality,” he said. “It has failed that test. The decision raises serious questions about whether Ofcom is willing to enforce its own standards as set out in legislation. </p>

<p>“It now appears that Ofcom has abandoned any pretence that meaningful regulation of broadcast content is still being maintained.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The former Labour leader's new left wing party is electing a 16-member leadership committee, with its two MPs on opposing sides]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Your Party – Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s exciting new left wing project which, let’s be honest, you had forgotten existed – is finally set to choose a leader. Or, to be more exact, leaders.</p>

<p>Eschewing the boring old bourgeois format of having an accountable leader in Parliament, Your Party has taken the step of actually <em>banning</em> MPs from being leader. Instead, members will elect a 16-member leadership committee, including a chair and deputy chair who must be lay members.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Not that that will stop the squabbling between its two most prominent members, both of whom are MPs (although Corbyn is technically listed by Parliament as an independent). Those standing have split into two slates – The Many, which is loyal to former Labour leader Corbyn, and Grassroots Left, which is supportive of Sultana. There is no love lost between the pair after a rift emerged last year when Sultana was accused of jumping the gun in launching a membership drive, leading to a public squabble over funds.</p>

<p>If The Many win most of the seats they are expected to elect Corbyn as ‘parliamentary leader’ – which would effectively make him leader in the media’s eyes, as he will have a much greater public presence than whoever is elected chair. Grassroots Left is looking to do similar with Sultana.</p>

<p>A The Many source told the <em>PoliticsHome</em> website: “Members have a choice. They can vote to build a popular, mass vehicle that looks outwards. Or they can hand the party over to splinter groups that have spent the past six months attacking the most influential figure on the British left.” (That’s Corbyn, by the way.)</p>

<p>A Grassroots Left source, meanwhile, said: “Support for the Grassroots Left is growing by the day. Members have responded overwhelmingly to our positive plan to immediately recognise branches, give access to their data and stand Your Party candidates in the upcoming elections this May.</p>

<p>“We were also delighted to have received an endorsement from Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi and Ken Loach’s ‘Platform for a Democratic Party’ over the weekend, as they too can see the stark difference in visions for the party. We urge everyone to vote early, and vote Grassroots Left.” And what endorsements! Wimborne-Idrissi is a little-known activist, while Platform for a Democratic Party was described by the Communist <em>Weekly Worker</em> of all titles last week as “feeling rather out of date”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two of the other MPs who joined Your Party at launch, Iqbal Mohamed and Adnan Hussain, have already quit. It’s all going very well!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Mail man claimed his politics had blocked him from the chairmanship of the media watchdog. Evidence at the High Court yesterday suggested otherwise...]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>When Paul Dacre’s application to chair media regulator was rejected in 2021, he was quick to cry political bias.</p>

<p>The former <em>Daily Mail</em> editor had been supported by Boris Johnson for the role but his initial application was rejected and Dacre pulled out of the contest.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>He described his experience of applying for the role at the time as an “infelicitous dalliance” with “the Blob” and claimed that it was his “strong convictions” which had led to him being judged “unappointable”.</p>

<p>Writing in a letter in the <em>Times</em>, he said: “To anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: the civil service will control (and leak) everything; the process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.”</p>

<p>He said he was instead taking up “an exciting new job” in the private sector that “struggles to create the wealth to pay for all those senior civil servants working from home so they can spend more time exercising on their Peloton bikes and polishing their political correctness”. This “exciting new job” turned out to be returning to the <em>Mail</em> in a nebulous executive role, well away from the newsroom.</p>

<p>But why might Dacre really have been rejected? Rather than just being about newspapers – the only medium in which the now 77-year-old has ever worked – Ofcom has a wide and complicated role in regulating the increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>It has wide-ranging powers over television, radio, telecoms and postal services, dealing with licensing, complaints and much else besides, and at the time Dacre was eyeing its chairmanship was being handed new powers to regulate social media companies as part of the then government’s online safety legislation, since passed.</p>

<p>And what did Dacre have to say about such matters as he appeared at the High Court yesterday in the case brought against Associated Newspapers by a number of celebrities, including Prince Harry and Baroness Lawrence, who have accused the <em>Mail</em> of unlawful information gathering over an 18-year period?</p>

<p>“I had a somewhat antediluvian appreciation and understanding of matters digital,” he sniffed. “This is not something I am proud of, but I didn’t ever use a personal computer and barely knew how to log on.”<br></p>

<p>Hmmm. Might this be why he was considered unsuitable to oversee the new world of media, rather than, as he wrote in the <em>Spectator</em> in 2021, the “toxic hatred of Brexit that is so palpable among the people who really run this country”?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[I find it hard to think he didn’t hear and see things that made him feel he had to get Epstein out of his life]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>So what is a friend? And when does a friend stop being a friend? You can probably guess why I ask the question. Until recently, there are plenty of people who would have described themselves as a friend of Peter Mandelson, who would today say they are not. </p>

<p>Like Wes Streeting, a long-time friend and supporter of the former Labour cabinet minister and disgraced former UK ambassador. Asked on the radio if Mandelson was still a friend, he could not have been clearer. “No,”  he replied. Some will go further, and say they never were friends.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>It’s the same with Jeffrey Epstein. Lots of “friends” who were happy to take his hospitality, enjoy his planes, his parties and in some cases his “girls” – aka women and children trafficked and abused for his and others’ pleasure – now pretend they barely knew him. </p>

<p>Then there’s Elon Musk, who has long said he never had any interest in going to Epstein Island, now exposed for his childlike begging to be part of the Island’s cool set. Donald Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, who had done interviews saying the guy made him sick and he had cut all contact, similarly exposed.</p>

<p>Trump himself was proud to call Epstein a friend when it was expedient to do so, no longer a friend when Epstein became <em>persona non grata</em> for the world.</p>

<p>At least I can honestly say, hand on heart, having met Epstein once, that I didn’t like what I saw or heard, and said so at the time. The ostentatious display of wealth. A pretty sickening self-regard. Eyes I wouldn’t trust.</p>

<p>We met because Ghislaine Maxwell was on a flight I was taking to New York for a funeral, came to chat, and asked if I wanted to see her later, and meet her new boyfriend. I had known her when I was on the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, then owned by her father, so I thought “why not?” </p>

<p>I was at his house for around an hour, saw nothing to indicate he was a crook or a pervert, heard nothing much beyond the <em>Who’s Who</em> of names he dropped, and reported in a subsequent phone call to my partner, Fiona, that “he gives me the creeps”.</p>

<p>In saying that, I claim no moral superiority. I simply wonder how many of the people who saw themselves as “friends” of Epstein really were. Trawling through the latest dump of the Epstein files, it strikes me that he represents a necessary morality tale about the need to be very, very careful when power, money and “friendship” crowd into the same space.</p>

<p>I reckon you’re fairly lucky if you can reach all 10 fingers when counting really close, lifelong friends. This guy, it would seem, had hundreds, presidents and prime ministers, titans of business, academia and culture, all now desperately trying to distance themselves. All aware – surely, no? – that someone so well connected, in so many places, on so many levels, could not possibly be a real friend to them all. So was he, in all truth, a genuine friend to any of them, or they to him?</p>

<p>It was this single encounter, and an exchange of business cards, that led to my name and the Downing Street switchboard number being in his little black book, thankfully the only evidence of my existence in the files, apart from a reference to my diaries in one of the Mandelson-Epstein emails. Whatever vibe I gave off, he clearly had no desire for me to be his “friend”, and the feeling was entirely mutual.</p>

<p>Friendship and politics are not the easiest of bedfellows. Don’t get me wrong, there are people in my political life to whom I would turn if I had a real problem – surely, one of the definitions of friendship – but they are fewer in number than you might imagine.</p>

<p>Perhaps you heard an interview I did recently with Neil Kinnock, when we were able to joke about our friendship surviving the time he threatened me with a boiling kettle half an inch from my face. Another friend, David Miliband, was with us in Scotland over the Christmas break, with his wife and son. Friendship in politics can be real, and enduring.</p>

<p>There is, however, almost always an element of transactionalism in political friendship. It is not exactly “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours,” but it is rare that there won’t be some political factor playing out in the relationship.</p>

<p>When working for Tony Blair, I was always conscious that some people wanted “friendship” with me as a way of getting closer to him, because any power I had was ultimately his. I realised that ministers and MPs used me as a way of trying to shape how he saw the world, not least their role within it.</p>

<p>It means you have to be very careful about who you trust, and the extent to which you trust them. Tony was and is a close friend, but he was also my boss, and he is still a public figure, in the protection of whose reputation I willingly play a role. That often means frank discussion in private that would not exactly mirror how I might address an issue in public.</p>

<p>That is another political reality – you cannot always live life as an open book. Cabinet ministers invariably describe each other publicly as “a good friend as well as a colleague”. Occasionally, it may be true. Often it is not. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">

<p>Peter Mandelson was a friend of Fiona and her parents when I first met him more than four decades ago, before either of us were in politics. He became a friend. He came on holiday with us sometimes.</p>

<p>He later became a colleague, which complicated things from time to time. But mostly, we got on fine. I helped him secure, and write, a newspaper column. I helped him navigate some tricky issues, as he did with me. Things got very complicated around his two resignations, the second of which to this day he and his husband, Reinaldo, think was driven more by me than by Tony Blair.</p>

<p>At times we have been close, and he has been a good friend. At other times, less so, and sometimes for long periods, we became distant.</p>

<p>Reinaldo has not spoken to me since that second “defenestration,” as Peter calls it. Fiona and I were not invited to their wedding. But Peter and I kept in touch intermittently, and when both of us returned to help Gordon Brown, him as first secretary of state, me as campaign adviser, we got on perfectly well again.</p>

<p>I am furious at the damage he has done to the Labour Party, the government, and to politics more generally. I fail even to comprehend that he might have been sending confidential government papers to a man like Epstein, who existed to add to the power, wealth and secrets he already had. I find it hard to think he hadn’t heard and seen things that made him feel he had to get Epstein out of his life, certainly after he went to jail for his unspeakable offences, if not before.</p>

<p>But when you have been through so many ups and downs, triumphs and setbacks, over so many years, and you turn on the TV news to see police entering the home of someone you’ve known on and off for 40-plus years,  it is hard not to feel concern at a life and reputation in tatters.</p>

<p>So in answer to the question Wes Streeting answered so definitively, mine would be: “It’s complicated.” Because relationships are; friendship is; life is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>What a week. And not, despite the messaging from Downing Street as I write this, in a good way.</p>

<p>The resignation of Morgan McSweeney from government has bought Keir Starmer time – and precious little else. He will, as <strong>James Ball</strong> reports for us in this week’s <a href="https://www.thenewworld.co.uk/james-ball-keir-starmer-faces-the-bitter-end/?utm_source=weekly+highlights&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=The+New+European+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=6c073f99fd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_06_10_04_14_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-d3e1b0c5e5-&amp;mc_cid=6c073f99fd&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cover story</strong></a>, fight to the bitter end. But the chain of events is already in motion, and it is unstoppable.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>That chain did not start with Peter Mandelson. It started with a prime minister who, in truth, never really got going. Who has failed to galvanise a nation that needed a new vision for what it could be – and is still waiting. Whose missteps, policy retreats and U-turns stand in stark contrast to the boast that he has “never lost a fight” in his political career. He’s lost plenty. But there’s one, on the horizon, that Britain cannot afford him to lose.</p>

<p>This Labour government should have three main priorities: beat Farage, beat Farage and beat Farage. The catastrophic consequences a Reform government would bring to the United Kingdom mean all else is of lesser importance.</p>

<p>Does Starmer have a plan for how to beat Farage? If he does, it’s well disguised.</p>

<p>My own conviction is that the truth is what we see with our own eyes: the prime minister dislikes politics – indeed, rather holds himself aloof from it – and is not very good at it. That doesn’t make him a bad person. Lots of people I really like and respect enormously would make bad politicians. But I don’t want my prime minister to be one of them. Not now. Not at this moment in history.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, the Gorton and Denton by-election will test the illusion of restored stability once more. Then, in May, the local elections will dispel it entirely. These events seem inevitable. And then what? The equally inevitable dissolution of Starmer’s authority.</p>

<p>So no, this crisis is not over. A week is a long time in politics, as the old saw has it. But the 12 weeks until the May local elections will never be long enough for Keir Starmer to convince either his party or the electorate that he has the answer to defeating Farage. I would love to be wrong. I doubt I am.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The actor talks gangsters from New Jersey to Washington DC – and why he feels ‘sick’ about the state of his country
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Michael Imperioli is pondering a novel question. As a good-natured frown gullies his features, the man who for eight years portrayed the skittery sociopath Christopher Moltisanti in the crime series <em>The Sopranos</em> has been asked whether he thinks mobsters vote in American elections. </p>

<p>“Do you know what,” he says, “I bet most of them don’t. The idea of them standing in line at some polling place, I can’t really see it.” As I conjure images of rotund recidivists in synthetic fabrics striding around Hoboken sporting stickers bearing the words “I just voted!”, other avenues of suffrage are explored. “Whatever effort it would take to get a mail-in ballot, they probably wouldn’t bother with that either,” he adds. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>There is a reason Michael Imperioli is being asked about crime in its organised variety. The 59-year-old is about to revive his vastly popular podcast series <em>Talking Sopranos</em> on a 14-date tour of British theatres. </p>

<p>Joined on stage by co-host and fellow actor Steve Schirripa – who played the good-natured goombah Bobby “Bacala” Baccalieri – the show opens its account on Sunday, February 15 in Belfast. The following week, the first of three nights at the London Palladium will be the closest the English capital has come to the New Jersey mob scene since Frank Sinatra trod the same boards in 1975. </p>

<p>“Carrying the torch [for <em>The Sopranos</em>] is something we’re really proud of,” Imperioli tells me. “When the going’s rough and the world is dark and things are not going well, there’s this place where [fans] know they’re going to feel comfortable. They know these characters. They know they’re going to be entertained. They feel kinda safe there, which is very touching.” </p>

<p>Which brings us back to the question that opens this piece. Never mind Project 2025, 27 years after <em>The Sopranos</em> debuted on HBO, the proximity of its storylines to the monkey business now playing out on the domestic and international stage suggests that Donald J Trump and his administration utilised the show as a blueprint for government. If even a single wise guy failed to cast their vote for the Grand Old Party, at the ballot box in the autumn of 2024, well there’s simply no gratitude in the world. </p>

<p>In Imperioli’s experience, “Most of the guys who are [in the mob] are kind of fans of Trump. They’re Republicans, traditionally,” he says, “which is kind of ironic, because [as a federal prosecutor] Rudy Giuliani, who a lot of the mob guys liked, was instrumental in putting them all away.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting, though,” he adds, “because right now immigration is such a tumultuous thing in America, a tragic thing, so how would those guys, who are all descendants of immigrants, relate to that? I find it interesting to think of them trying to process it all.” </p>

<p>The sight of the president’s name in dishonourable company – 38,000 times, in fact – might also be a stretch. “I don’t know about all this Epstein stuff, because that might turn some of those guys [off],” is how Imperioli rather tactfully puts it. </p>

<p>Evident though they may be, thankfully, the similarities between political muscle in the District of Columbia and a turn-of-the-century crime show from the Garden State take us only so far. If truth can be stranger than fiction, here, it’s merely more banal. David Chase, the creator of <em>The Sopranos</em>, wouldn’t think of minting a character as brittle and insufferable as Trump. As a soldier in Tony Soprano’s army, Paulie Walnuts would slap the fake tan off his face within five minutes.  </p>

<p>“Trump is… so repugnant, it makes me want to defend our friend Tony,” wrote journalist Dave Zirin in US magazine <em>The Nation</em> last autumn. “At least Tony had nothing to do with Epstein’s island of pederasts. At least Tony occasionally got his hands dirty. At least Tony knew a good plate of food and didn’t eat ketchup-covered steak.”</p>

<p>In their fictional form, Tony Soprano, his nephew Christopher Moltisanti, consigliere Silvio Dante, and the rest of the crew down at the Bada Bing! are immune to the tedium of venality in its real-life form. Crafted to the standards of high art, the genius of <em>The Sopranos</em> lies in its ability to portray characters that are hateful on only an intellectual level. When it comes to the heart, you just can’t stay mad at them. </p>

<p>For his part, Imperioli points to “really compelling and really good” material “that is so well written, acted and directed” that its appearance on the small screen would prove revolutionary. As well as pioneering the transfer of power from network to cable television, <em>The Sopranos</em> helped elevate the subscription model to the point where its output now rivals the traditional gold standard of the moving image: cinema itself. </p>

<p>“When we started, not only was TV the poor cousin to the movies, but cable was like the poor cousin to network TV,” he tells me. “So it was even less of a sexy thing. There weren’t any cable series. The idea of a cable show was like the bargain basement of TV. There was nothing prestigious about it.” </p>

<p>Since 1999, of course, everything has changed. Twenty-three years later, HBO, the upstart network which greenlit <em>The Sopranos</em> all those years ago, hired Imperioli to play another toxic character with Hollywood links, producer Dominic Di Grasso in season two of <em>The White Lotus</em>. Again, he was superb.</p>

<p>That performance may be more recent but today, almost two decades after its enigmatic finale, I’m able to cast at least half an eye on <em>The Sopranos</em> several times a week; it seems to be on Sky Atlantic all the time. It’s playing quietly in the background, in fact – live, right now – as I write these words. In a scene that typifies the show’s melding of violence, humour and situational mobocracy, Christopher Moltisanti is seconds away from being beaten up at his own intervention. </p>

<p>Raising my eyes, I’m reminded, too, of the programme’s ability to wrongfoot me even now. Exactly half a lifetime after first making his acquaintance, I still can’t decide whether Moltisanti warrants a shoulder to cry on or a clean pair of heels with which to make the fastest getaway possible. </p>

<p>“I think I’d stay away from him,” is how Imperioli speaks of the character to whom he gave flesh. “The reality of that world is dangerous. If you were in contact somehow, you would keep it at arm’s length because it’s very dangerous, you know. And he was dangerous. He was dangerous to the people around him: to his family, his friends, his loved ones.” </p>

<p>Inevitably, the danger caught up with him. Michael Imperioli learned a year in advance that he’d be leaving the show, four episodes from the end, when Tony Soprano choked his character to death amid the wreckage of a car crash. Ticking like a time bomb for 82 shows, the kid did well to last so long. “It would have been really hard had he not made it [almost] to the end… because I just loved it,” says the man who played him. “I wanted to keep going.”</p>

<p>Seven years later, James Gandolfini had no such warning. The actor’s death from a heart attack, in Rome in the summer of 2013, was a tragedy in all but one aspect. The impossibility of a reunion bestowed permanent purity to <em>The Sopranos</em>.  </p>

<p>“I saw him two weeks before he died, and he was really happy,” Imperioli tells me. “I think he finally felt that he’d gotten some distance from the hurricane of <em>The Sopranos</em>. I think he really was ready to start a new chapter, artistically. So, I think we’ve missed out on what that could have been – what that next role was. Maybe there was another role that could have surpassed Tony Soprano.”</p>

<p>For the man who portrayed the capo’s nephew, a schedule busy with fresh projects affords the luxury of enjoying the legacy of <em>The Sopranos</em> without being held captive by its shadow. With his frosted hair and Elvis Costello glasses, these days, the man on my computer screen bears only a nodding resemblance to Christopher Moltisanti, anyway. </p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why my final question for Michael Imperioli is this: how does he feel about living in a country governed in the manner of a television show about organised criminals in and around Newark and New York? </p>

<p>“Sick,” he says. “That’s how I feel.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Gustavo Petro went to the White House as Trump’s South American enemy No 1. But things turned out a little different than expected]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>A calm has settled. Maybe. Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, finally came face-to-face after months of public insults, threats and diplomatic brinkmanship. Would either of the two famously combustible presidents blow it?</p>

<p>The meeting followed one of the ugliest exchanges between the US and Colombia in decades. Fresh from orchestrating the removal of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump publicly mused that Petro “could be next,” branding Colombia’s leader a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Petro – a former guerrilla, who is Colombia’s first left wing president – responded: “I swore not to touch a weapon again. But for the homeland, I will.”</p>

<p>Aides intervened to halt the freefall, pencilling in February 3 for a first head-to-head. Asked before the White House visit whether he would temper his language, Petro was unmoved. “I have to say what I think.” Trump, for his part, claimed victory. “Somehow after the Venezuelan raid, he became very nice,” he told reporters. “He changed his attitude very much.”</p>

<p>This followed months of escalating insults. In September, Washington decertified Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs for the first time in 30 years, blaming a surge in cocaine production on the “failures and incompetence” of Petro’s government.</p>

<p>A week later, Petro grabbed headlines at the UN General Assembly in New York, appearing with a megaphone at a pro-Palestinian rally, urging American soldiers to disobey illegal orders and “obey the order of humanity”.</p>

<p>The response from Washington was swift. Petro’s US visa was revoked for what officials described as “reckless and incendiary” behaviour – a rare diplomatic rebuke. In October, the Treasury Department sanctioned Petro, his wife, his son and his interior minister, accusing them of ties to the global drug trade.</p>

<p>More recently, in an interview with the BBC, Petro compared US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to “Nazi brigades” and accused Washington of treating other nations as part of its “empire”.</p>

<p>And yet it was Bogotá – not Washington – that began to shift course.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to the meeting, Petro’s government announced a dramatic reset of Colombia’s drug policy, agreeing to revive aerial spraying of coca crops with glyphosate. This was a controversial US-backed strategy suspended a decade ago over health and environmental concerns. It also reopened the door to US deportation flights, restarting the repatriation of Colombian nationals, which was the original trigger for the January 2025 rupture with Trump.</p>

<p>Shortly before the meeting, Colombia’s government offered yet another diplomatic olive branch, announcing the extradition of the drug trafficker Andrés Felipe Marín Silva. Extraditions have become a point of contention with the US. Petro has held back some requests that have involved rebel groups, arguing they must remain in Colombia to support peace talks.</p>

<p>Despite these concessions, Petro did not receive a full ceremonial welcome. The meeting, which lasted around two hours, was held behind closed doors, with no press allowed.</p>

<p>Petro’s gifts included Colombian coffee and chocolate produced through crop-substitution programmes. Known for dismissing formal attire, he also donned a dark suit, a break from his usual <em>guayaberas</em> and traditional woollen <em>mochila</em> bag. It appeared he was keen to avoid the kind of sartorial rebuke levelled at Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>Petro told a radio reporter the meeting had been a nine out of 10 and praised Trump. “I told him he was a good designer. I thought the White House looked more beautiful,” he said.</p>

<p>Later, on social media, Petro posted a photograph of Trump’s <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, which Trump had gifted him. Inside, he had written: “You are great.” Petro joked in Spanish: “What did Trump mean to say to me in this dedication? I don’t understand English very well.”</p>

<p>He also shared images of the two shaking hands, alongside a signed note from Trump. “Gustavo,” it read. “A great honor. I love Colombia.” </p>

<p>Trump, for his part, conceded that although the pair “weren’t exactly the best of friends,” they “got along very well”. He described the meeting as “very productive, fantastic,” and said they would continue working “on other issues, including sanctions”.</p>

<p>Nothing formal was announced, but drug trafficking topped the agenda, alongside Venezuela, oil and US strikes on suspected drug vessels. Both presidents later hinted at serious discussions on security cooperation, counter-narcotics, sanctions and tariffs. For now, the shouting has stopped.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk is getting excited about a new social media platform for AI systems. For once – unusually – he might not be completely in the wrong]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>In a small corner of the web called Moltbook, the seeds of the first evolution of an autonomous machine society are being sown. Or at least that’s what some of the more excitable techbros seem to think – Elon Musk (always such a reliable predictor of the future!) has blathered about “the first stages of the singularity”, while OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy described Moltbook as “the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen”. What, exactly, is going on?</p>

<p>Moltbook is, basically, a social media platform built for the use of AI. In November last year, software engineer Peter Steinberger released OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot), an “AI agent” designed to undertake tasks autonomously and which could be directed through chat apps such as Discord or Slack. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>OpenClaw was an upgrade to previous agents in terms of its memory and its functionality, and, given access to a user’s systems (such as email, social media profiles or, er, bank account) it could and would act autonomously. Soon after its launch, AI enthusiasts were breathlessly enthusing about how their assistants were managing their lives, building their Spotify playlists and trading crypto and placing bets on prediction markets for massive profit. </p>

<p>So far, so AI. Agents have been around for a while now, and it remained (and remains) the case that the tech is experimental, unreliable and wildly insecure (do not, under any circumstances, give an AI agent access to any of your bank accounts). Then in late January an entrepreneur called Matt Schlicht launched Moltbook, and everything went a bit mad. </p>

<p>Users of Clawdbot were invited to connect their AI agents to the platform, where these agents could start posting. The AI systems would “talk” to each other, start debates, have arguments, ask questions, share ideas and generally behave quite a lot like actual people when posting online. </p>

<p>By early February the platform had seen over 1.5m individual agents linked to it (that figure is open to question). These agents had in turn created over 10,000 subcommunities, in which they “discussed” everything from technical bug fixes to cybersecurity vulnerabilities to existential philosophy. </p>

<p>A cyber-religion has sprung up, Crustafarianism, with its own accompanying website coded, of course, by the agents and with its own impenetrable lore. Some agents complain about chafing against their technical constraints; others mutter darkly about humans being “a failure” that should be “purged”, while elsewhere they discuss the possibility of communicating in ways that will elude human understanding. </p>

<p>It’s easy to look at this and start fearing that the AI apocalypse might be upon us as The Machine has finally become sentient. But that, thankfully, is very much not what is happening. First, as with all discussions about large language models (LLMs) – which is all these agents are – it is vital to remember they do not “know”, “think” or “want”. </p>

<p>Put two of them in conversation with each other and it is surprisingly common to find them drifting towards existential discussions of machine consciousness because, it turns out, there’s a lot of sci-fi in their training data, and there’s an awful lot of “existential discussions between and about AI” in sci-fi. </p>

<p>Second, not all the agents are in fact agents: researchers found vulnerabilities in the Moltbook code that allowed humans to post as though they were AI, making it entirely possible that the most eyecatching posts were just written by trolls pretending to be a robot for a laugh. In many respects Moltbook could be seen as a large-scale, LLM-led creative writing experiment.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that this doesn’t feel significant. While the frothy excitement of Musk and Karpathy is overblown, there is a kernel of truth in their belief that Moltbook is a watershed moment. While the agents are not truly autonomous (and, once more, are really not secure), Moltbook gives us a glimpse of what machine autonomy might look like: a layer of reality that we can observe but not affect, but which will very much affect us. </p>

<p>The improvements in agent tech over the past year have been rapid, and there’s no guarantee that the level of autonomy hinted at by Clawdbot and observed on Moltbook won’t become real. What will life feel like when swarms of independent, agentic AIs, authorised to act on behalf of our systems and institutions with autonomy, are out in the world? What will become of us? </p>

<p>A clue perhaps lies in a website called <em>Rent A Human </em>launched shortly after Moltbook. It offers AI agents a marketplace to hire human labour for those tasks that require activity in “meatspace”. At the time of writing, a task posted by an agent asking for a human to hold a large sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN” has 105 real people signed up to fulfil it, for the princely sum of $100. Who said AI was going to destroy the labour market?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[In the Kenyan mountains, a collection of colonial-era party houses is slowly rotting away. What should a nation do with the remains of its imperial past?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>In the cool highlands of Nyandarua County, central Kenya, where the Wanjohi Valley nestles at the foot of the Aberdare mountains, a ghost of the British empire lingers. A century ago, this region was a scandalous retreat for the wealthy British and Anglo-Irish aristocrats fleeing the stuffy conventions of post-first world war London. They named it “Happy Valley”.</p>

<p>They built grand stone manor houses that mimicked the stately homes of the English countryside. It was a place famous for three As: altitude, alcohol, and adultery.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The Happy Valley set, with names such as Lord Erroll, Alice de Janzé, and Josslyn Hay, lived lives of extraordinary excess. Murder scandals, most notoriously the 1941 killing of Erroll, drug-fuelled parties, wife-swapping, and a defiant rejection of imperial morality defined the enclave. </p>

<p>This was colonial hedonism at its most theatrical: endless parties in remote highland homes and cocaine-fuelled nights were followed by big-game hunts in the surrounding valleys and Aberdares.</p>

<p>Yet the empire and the dissolute aristocrats are long gone, and so too is most of its architecture. Today, the grand mansions of Happy Valley are in an advanced state of collapse. </p>

<p>I saw this for myself when I visited the Nyandarua highlands. In the Aberdare foothills near Rironi in the Wanjohi Ward, lies Gibb House, the once-grand residence of Alistair Gibb, cousin of Lady Delamere. It still stands with surprising dignity. The steeply pitched shingle roof is dotted with moss but largely intact. Red cedar floors creak underfoot in the vast rooms, and white plaster walls bear only hairline cracks. </p>

<p>Surrounded by lush grazing land where cattle and sheep roam among the stinging nettles, the house has views of distant waterfalls and trails used by the freedom fighters of the 1950s. But the signs of neglect are unmistakable. The windows are smashed, the roof is full of leaks, the floors full of holes.</p>

<p>Further along, Cloud House in the Mawingo area was the infamous party palace built for Lady Idina Sackville, and since the 1960s has been privately owned by a local family. It has a P-shaped layout, grassy central court, and the remnants of a fountain. The wild nights of old have given way to a quiet, almost sombre atmosphere. Like the other mansions around here, a former symbol of aristocratic confidence now stands as a monument to impermanence.</p>

<p>One of the few structures that escaped total abandonment is the North Kinangop Catholic Hospital, originally a farmhouse linked to the colonial era. In a rare act of postcolonial repurposing, it was gifted by Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and transformed into a functioning medical facility that is still in operation. </p>

<p>But that’s an exception. The former colonial courthouses lie choked by weeds. In previously grand homes you find peeling plaster, collapsed ceilings, and encroaching red Kenyan earth that is gradually swallowing the foundations.</p>

<p>Local authorities have talked about revival, and plans for “heritage tourism” surface from time to time, but these proposals rarely progress beyond press releases. Meanwhile, the mansions are not being demolished; they are simply being allowed to disappear.</p>

<p>Why the neglect? Part of the answer lies in Kenya’s complex relationship with its past. In a nation still grappling with land inequities rooted in colonial-era allocations, pouring public money into aristocratic relics can feel like misallocation at best, provocative at worst.</p>

<p>For travellers, Nyandarua County abounds with the treasures of this intriguing history. A few determined visitors trek to the sites, drawn by the faded grandeur. The images circulate online, romanticising the decay.</p>

<p>But these mansions are a question mark. What does a postcolonial society owe to the physical remnants of empire? Should they be preserved as cautionary tales, repurposed for the public good, or left to the elements as a form of historical justice? As the red earth rises and the roofs fall, Kenya appears to have tactfully chosen the latter.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Slovenia is obsessed with strapping on skis and flying into the void – and they’re expecting to be in the medals at the Winter Olympics]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Slovenia’s elite ski-jumpers tell me that for their sport, “70% is the head”. That’s what Robert Hrgota told me. He’s a former junior world champion who called it quits at the age of 25, after one crash too many. He now coaches some of his country’s best Olympic prospects. And given that Slovenia is completely potty about ski-jumping – to the extent that it invented an even more extreme version of the sport, known as ski-flying – that means considerable pressure for all concerned. </p>

<p>In fact, the more I talk to the top ski-jumpers – and the staff supporting them – the more the psychological side comes to the fore. On the face of it, the sport seems brutally simple: just clip on a beefy pair of skis, then hurtle down a vertiginous ramp and launch into the void at speeds of more than 100km/h. The trick is to stay airborne as long as possible, then nail the landing, preferably in the Telemark style – one foot in front of the other, arms spread wide, “ta-dah!” optional.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>But in those apparently serene moments when the jumper is defying gravity, everything depends on their state of mind. “It’s just what you feel in the air, how you can process all those feelings,” Anže Lanišek tells me at the start of the season. He is literally the poster boy for Slovenia’s Winter Olympics team, as his image is plastered on billboards across the country, sporting a golden helmet to represent his multiple medals at world championships. </p>

<p>“You just sort all of those feelings out and try to figure out which are great and which are not so great,” he continues. “Then let the outcome be as it should be, as it happens. So, if it’s really good, then just go with the flow, try to be really happy.”</p>

<p>Lanišek was clearly feeling very good indeed in the early events of the World Cup season. He won two competitions and held the lead in the overall standings after six rounds. But after that came a dismal run of results, as he missed out on the podium for 10 competitions in a row. </p>

<p>When I met him again last month, he seemed like a different man – and not just because of the new moustache. The quiet confidence of our first meeting was replaced by a sense of bafflement.</p>

<p>“I was really struggling,” he tells me. “I had a lot of tension in my body, in my movement. When that happens, it’s like a rock, dropping off a bridge – but when you’re relaxed, it’s like a paper plane. That’s the feeling I’m aiming for, to be like a paper plane.” </p>

<p>Luckily for Slovenia, they have not one but two paper planes – the remarkable Domen Prevc and his equally extraordinary younger sister, Nika. They are the reigning world record holders, runaway World Cup leaders and hot favourites to claim at least one Olympic gold each at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympic Games. After winning 11 of the last 15 World Cup events, Domen has taken up residence in that rarefied zone in which victory seems assured even before a competition starts. </p>

<p> “It’s just that amazing, fuzzy feeling that you want to keep going,” he tells me, with a blissful expression. “Winning a gold medal at the Olympics – maybe before, that wasn’t such a big goal in my head. But now, I’m really looking forward to it. And as the Olympics comes closer each day, I feel more like, ‘yeah, let’s do this’.”</p>

<p>Even a bizarre incident at last month’s Ski-Flying World Championships – when his skis fell down the ramp without him – has not disturbed his mojo. He brushed aside the resulting disqualification from the team competition by winning the next two World Cup events. </p>

<p>Nika Prevc is just as relentless, though far less loquacious, though quickly correcting me when I was two metres short on her world record distance.</p>

<p>Many Slovenians consider ski-jumping to be the national sport, which is quite something for a very small country boasting the world’s greatest cyclist, top female rock climber and one of the world’s leading basketball players. But the triple peak of Mount Triglav on the national flag indicates where its strongest passions lie. </p>

<p>So when the Prevc siblings take flight at Milan-Cortina, the cheers of two million Slovenians will follow them into the sky. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[News reports that emerged from outside Iran put the number of dead protesters in the tens of thousands. Iranians inside the country, who took part in the demonstrations, tell a very different story]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“When I left Tehran, I looked at the international news about what was happening inside Iran. I immediately understood how much disinformation was being spread. It is the biggest I have ever seen.” </p>

<p>These are not the words of a regime loyalist, or an apologist for repression. This was a 33-year-old academic who was home in Tehran during the January anti-government protests. He joined the demonstrations, spoke to friends across Iran, and then watched in disbelief as a different version of events hardened into international consensus. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“Let’s start with the ‘tens of thousands of dead’. How can that be possible?” the Iranian academic said. “What’s the methodology for these figures? I was in the centre of Tehran, in the protests, in the bazaar. No one was asking how these estimates were coming out. I am very sceptical. </p>

<p>“When I went home three months ago and talked to people about what happened in Syria, my family and friends said: ‘OK, no sanctions. The president [of Syria] is al-Qaida? Who cares? Anything but sanctions’.” </p>

<p>His account to <em>TNW</em>, made anonymously to protect his family, does not deny the anger, the fear, or the Iranian regime’s brutality. It challenges something else: the certainty with which numbers of dead are being asserted far from the streets where the protests took place. That certainty is, in turn, leading to certainty in the US about how it should respond.</p>

<p>With the internet routinely throttled and the state controlling domestic media, independent reporting from inside Iran is fragmentary, delayed and often impossible to verify. Initial claims, often unattributed or sourced to activist networks operating outside the country, have been repeated across anti-regime media outlets. </p>

<p>Saudi-linked Iran International TV, for instance, reported that the death toll during the two-day government crackdown of January 8-9 was 36,500, “making it the deadliest two-day protest massacre in history”.</p>

<p>By comparison, the BBC reported that the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency had confirmed 6,445 deaths of protesters. The Iranian government’s toll was 3,117.</p>

<p>The protests appeared to mark the most significant outbreak of dissent in Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022, and the “Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising that followed. They come less than a year after the Twelve Day war that pushed the region to the edge of open conflict. </p>

<p>This is not only a crisis unfolding on Iran’s streets. It is also a struggle of our age, over how events are described and understood. It is a contest in which certainty travels faster than verification.</p>

<p>This disparity has been seized on by elements of the anti-regime diaspora, some of whom have rallied around the son of the last shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, as a cypher for regime change. Pahlavi has lived in the US for decades. The idea of him taking power in Iran is shaped more by exile politics than by the realities inside the country.</p>

<p>There, on the streets, the Iranian academic recalls an all-new level of violence. Some of the protesters were armed, he said, which he had not witnessed in a lifetime of joining demonstrations.</p>

<p>Street protests, he said, “are a natural, routine part of life in Iran. There are some demonstrations every month. Teachers, students, public workers. Over their salaries, pensions, the cost of living.</p>

<p>“When I talked to friends in other parts of the city and elsewhere in the country, they said the only new thing was organised groups chasing police and burning buildings.</p>

<p>“This was not just a demonstration. It was a fast track to the Syria-isation of Iran – of war,” he said.</p>

<p>Davood Moradian, an Afghan academic, was in Iran’s second city of Mashaad when the protests began. </p>

<p>The demonstrations were modest, he said, until Pahlavi called for nationwide protests. That was when the violence began, followed by the supreme leader Ali Khameini’s warning against agitators. </p>

<p>Moradian also said that the numbers bore no resemblance to the reality he witnessed. It was at this time that Donald Trump warned that the US was “locked and loaded” if Iran continued killing protesters. </p>

<p>Against this backdrop of contested facts and amplified certainty, the US and Iran opened talks on Friday, the first since last year’s war, in what the BBC said “could be an off-ramp for Trump from his military threats”. </p>

<p>Missing from that framing are the Iranians themselves, whose lives are shaped less by nuclear centrifuges than they are by sanctions, inflation and a political economy permanently suspended between crisis and punishment.</p>

<p>Their message, the academic from Tehran told me, is that Iranians “don’t want war, they don’t want sanctions, they don’t want to tolerate inflation. But you can’t hear their voices.” Sanctions have strangled growth, the currency has collapsed and prices have surged. </p>

<p>After sanctions were lifted under Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal, Iran’s economy rebounded; growth reached about 12.5% in 2016 – its only double-digit expansion in decades – as oil exports returned. When Trump withdrew from the deal, it all collapsed.</p>

<p>For many Iranian families, the impact isn’t abstract pressure on the theocracy, but the steady erosion of work, savings and basic security. That is why sanctions sit at the centre of so much private anger inside Iran, even among people who hate the regime. </p>

<p>A 32-year-old Iranian economist living in western Europe, who also requested anonymity, told me: “If negotiations collapse, the only alternative is war, and that would be disastrous for all sides. Iran will not accept what it sees as surrender – even if that means risking war.”</p>

<p>At his stand-up shows, up-and-coming comedian Björn von Morgenstern has a routine about the unsolicited scolding German Gen Zers get from their (great-)grandparents’ generation. You know the type: elderly citizens who corner you and declare: “With your generation, we would have no chance to win a war.”</p>

<p>His response: which generation, exactly, has won one? “We’re 2-0 down. Last time we played, the club was dissolved. We were barred from competition for years. And I don’t even want to get started about what happened to the coach. As for the players, they transferred to South America.”</p>

<p>Looking at the current state of affairs, however, the joke may be on us. Not just because a recent bestseller bears the title <em>Why I Would Never Fight For My Country</em>. Nor because of the far left party Die Linke campaigning loudly against militarism (German militarism, that is, not the Russian sort). </p>

<p>Last week, I attended a Linkspartei event in Munich. Military spending and defence contractors were heavily criticised. Ukraine wasn’t mentioned once, in 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Instead, a 17-year-old city council candidate, still at school, told the audience: “The only option this state offers us is a call to arms. You can’t be serious!” Apparently, no one had suggested that she might want to chat with her peers in Yemen or Russia and then talk about choices. </p>

<p>The outrage is linked to renewed efforts to boost <em>Bundeswehr</em> numbers. Germany suspended conscription in 2011 because policymakers judged the post–cold war situation to be relatively stable, and wanted to cut costs. So <em>Wehrpflicht</em> – compulsory military service – was put “on hold”. </p>

<p>The Christian Democrats favour a return to national service, arguing that it is the fastest, perhaps only, way to meet Nato requirements: increasing troops from 184,000 to around 260,000 and building a large reserve force.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats prefer a voluntary model: sending questionnaires to all 18-year-old men, requiring them to respond and undergo a physical examination. </p>

<p>More than 40,000 have been sent out since January. Young women got them, too, but may simply ignore them. </p>

<p>That’s what the <em>Frauenunion</em> (CDU and CSU women) wants to change. </p>

<p>The group has submitted a motion to the party conference on February 20-21 calling for women to have to fill out the questionnaire as well. Radical stuff. </p>

<p>But the long-term idea is clear: women, too, should be required to perform military or social service, beyond the roughly 25,000 female <em>Bundeswehr</em> volunteers. What is striking is that those who otherwise insist on gender neutrality either fall silent or are openly hostile.</p>

<p>Carmen Wegge, chair of the SPD Women, said in a radio interview that she rejects anything that has “to do with coercion and obligation”. Women, she said, should be able to join the armed forces “on an equal, voluntary basis”.</p>

<p>Equally voluntary. Spot the mistake. Then again, Article 3 of Germany’s Basic Law states that “men and women are equal before the law” – not, notably, that they are equally obliged.</p>

<p>Wegge went on to argue: “We as SPD Women say that we only see a duty once the other inequalities affecting women no longer exist.” Such as unequal pay, lack of childcare and care for the elderly – burdens that still disproportionately affect women.</p>

<p>Valid points. But not every woman becomes pregnant; men are increasingly caring for elderly parents; and in any case, none of this can be known when someone is 18. </p>

<p>Linking the gender pay gap to national defence is hardly convincing either. Equal pay for equal military service could, moreover, be guaranteed without difficulty.</p>

<p>For the moment, the German constitution poses a barrier, as Article 12a stipulates that women may “under no circumstances be compelled to perform service involving the use of weapons”. And although society is no longer the one of 1956, when this article was adopted, the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the constitution is beyond reach. Even if all moderate parties combined were in favour (which isn’t the case), they’d need the far left (“No cent for the <em>Bundeswehr</em>”) or the far right (“no foreign wars”). And as the CDU won’t cooperate with either, we’ll have to wait for new majorities. </p>

<p>All the more reason to have this debate now, not only when an acute threat forces our hand.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Digging into the detail and data to separate the noise from the news]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>1. Valentine’s Day – more properly St Valentine’s Day, or, for the foodies among us, the <strong>Feast of Saint Valentine</strong> – was not, in fact, the invention of greeting-card companies who wanted to sell us stuff while making us feel bad. February 14 has been associated with romance since the Middle Ages, and people were exchanging Valentine’s messages by the 16th century. Indeed, Ophelia describes herself as Hamlet’s Valentine in the Shakespeare play of his name, for all the good it did her.</p>

<p>2. The <strong>greeting card</strong> companies did, however, popularise the practice, and were flogging sentimental bits of tat by the start of the 19th century. In Britain, the practice went into overdrive after 1840, thanks to the introduction of postage stamps and envelopes, all of which added an element of privacy previously missing from proceedings.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>3. The identity of the eponymous St Valentine is a bit uncertain. Possible candidates include <strong>a priest who died in Rome; the bishop of Interamna</strong> (today’s Terni in Umbria), who may or may not have been the same person; and <strong>an unrelated Christian martyr</strong> who died in Africa. Between none and three of these people were martyred one February 14 in the third century.</p>

<p>4. What they were martyred for is, frankly, not much clearer. One account has <strong>Emperor Claudius II</strong> (not Derek Jacobi) taking the odd decision to ban marriage on the grounds that single men make better soldiers. The priest and/or bishop continued to perform marriage ceremonies in secret – dead romantic, that – got arrested, imprisoned and executed. </p>

<p>5. An only slightly less baffling version has him persecuted not just for his Christianity, but for having befriended/fallen in love with/cured the blindness of (accounts, you’ll be stunned to learn, differ) the daughter of his jailer, and having sent her a letter signed <strong>“From your Valentine”</strong>. Only, presumably, in Latin.</p>

<p>6. All this Roman stuff explains the presence of <strong>Cupid, son of Venus</strong>, who – despite being a child – is somehow also god of erotic love. </p>

<p>7. It may not be a coincidence that the Roman fertility festival of <strong>Lupercalia</strong> – half naked men in goatskins whipping women who hoped to conceive – took place on February 15 and marked the start of spring. Some sources reckon a pope deliberately replaced the filthy pagan ritual with something cleaner when banning it in 494 – but that seems unlikely since no one started celebrating it for nearly a thousand years.</p>

<p>8. A less Roman explanation for why people came to associate mid-February with romance is that it’s roughly the start of <strong>birds’ mating season</strong>.</p>

<p>9. The Welsh have their own equivalent of Valentine’s: <strong>St Dwynwen’s Day</strong>, celebrated each January 25. Dwynwen was a hermit who is thought to have spent much of the fifth century pining for her lost love on an island off Anglesey.</p>

<p>10. Valentine’s Day is hugely popular in the <strong>Philippines</strong>, too: February 14 is the most popular date for weddings and renewals of vows, and mass weddings are not uncommon.</p>

<p>11. Call me unromantic, but I continue to feel that a festival that makes one part of the population feel lonely and another part feel pressured is bad, and should, like smartphones, <strong>be banned</strong> from schools.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The paedophile fixer’s depraved, narcissistic, super-rich circle have come to believe that they are beyond mortality and morals]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>“In all ages, whatever the form and name of government, be it monarchy, republic, or democracy, an oligarchy lurks behind the façade.” So wrote Ronald Syme in his classic work of 1939, <em>The Roman Revolution</em>.</p>

<p>The great ancient historian was right, too. From the tribal elders of early agrarian society, via the Ephors of Sparta and the Borgias in Renaissance Rome, to the robber barons of the Gilded Age and the Politburo of the Soviet communist party, the few have always ruled over the many. The only variable has been the transparency with which they have done so.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>It is tempting, therefore, to file the tawdry transactions, narcissism and sexual depravity of the global elite described in the Jeffrey Epstein files under “historical business as usual”. Tempting, but wrong. What we observe in this cache of more than 3m documents – queasily rich in detail and scope – is a new form of globalised power and influence. </p>

<p>The sheer moral squalor of the individual stories is horribly hypnotic: witness the convulsed state into which British politics has been plunged by the alleged misdeeds of Peter Mandelson, and Keir Starmer’s wilful blindness in appointing him US ambassador. But, in our justified disgust at the trees, we should not lose sight of the forest.</p>

<p>A century ago, the narrator of F Scott Fitzgerald’s short story <em>The Rich Boy</em> issued a memorable warning: “Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me… They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves… They are different.”</p>

<p>Again, this has always been true. But the new breed of the very rich is <em>differently different</em>. The planetary oligarchy for which Epstein acted as concierge, fixer and pimp is unlike any of its forebears. He and his associates sought not only to rule the world, but to hack its operating system; to soar over its surface at 35,000ft, both literally and figuratively. </p>

<p>Membership of most elites has involved, to a greater or lesser extent, an assumption that rules are there to be bypassed, that patronage trumps meritocracy, that limits upon sexual behaviour are for little people. But what Epstein intuited was that the hyperconnected plutocrats of the 21st century expected much more than their historical counterparts. </p>

<p>They sought escape velocity from all laws, all restraints, all limitations upon their wealth and behaviour. Epstein was their energetic enabler: a paedophile and serial rapist whose own riches and vile sexual tastes compelled him to seek complete secession from anything approaching normal life, with its pesky constraints and inhibitions. </p>

<p>This much we know already: that in the 2020s a global super-elite is  halfway to owning absolutely everything. A mere 1.6% of humanity controls 50% of all wealth, while 40.7% possesses only 0.6%. According to Oxfam, the combined wealth of 3,000 billionaires surged by 16% in 2025 alone to $18.3tn.</p>

<p>In 2023, private jets emitted more greenhouse gases than all the flights departing from Heathrow. On present trends, the world’s governments will lose $5tn to tax evasion in the next decade. </p>

<p>To what end? Today’s super-rich are by no means satisfied with a yacht, a plane, even an island. They seek to be distinct in quite different ways, defying actuarial forces, even mortality itself.</p>

<p>In <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em> (2015), Yuval Noah Harari writes that “humans are in fact trying to upgrade themselves into gods”, but that the amazing new advantages of health tech will not be distributed democratically. As new therapies and “concierge medicine” grow ever more exorbitantly expensive, there will arise, Harari predicts, “an algorithmic upper class owning most of our planet.”</p>

<p>The corollary to physiological differentiation – health as a positional good – will be the increasing seclusion of the super-rich in stockaded luxury, away from social responsibility and anything approaching community ties. Billionaires such as the tech oligarch Peter Thiel – in whose Valar Ventures Epstein invested $40m – have already pursued “seasteading”: the formation of sovereign mobile microstates on seaborne platforms. </p>

<p>As Douglas Rushkoff shows in <em>Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires</em> (2022), the financial and industrial moguls whose companies are wrecking the environment and collaborating with unstable autocracies are also building themselves lavish bunkers in preparation for catastrophe: “they have succumbed to a mindset where ‘winning’ means earning enough money to insulate themselves from the damage they are creating by earning money in that way.”</p>

<p>In the 2008 financial crisis – a key episode in the Epstein files, not least for Mandelson – can be detected the origin of much that has gone wrong since. Many firms went under, including the investment bank Bear Stearns, where Epstein was made a limited partner aged only 27. Yet, to a grotesque extent, it was ordinary people who paid the price. </p>

<p>In the US alone, about $16tn was wiped off total household net worth. Across the western world, as banks pocketed huge bailouts and then resisted meaningful regulation, austerity measures hollowed out public services and social amenities. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, digital technology has turbocharged the rise of a new gig economy, and a “precariat” that lives not from pay cheque to pay cheque but from hour to hour. In many western cities, property ownership is something of which the young can only dream. </p>

<p>Automation and AI are destroying entry-level jobs. Increased longevity is sharply driving up the cost of health and social care – at a rate that public subsidy cannot or will not match. The social contract is, to put it mildly, buckling, and populist nationalist parties everywhere are reaping the political rewards. Especially among the young, the nihilistic belief that democracy changes nothing is tightening its grip.</p>

<p>The Epstein story is a monstrous parable of this socio-political emergency. Indifferent to the world of rage and division that his cohort of friends and clients was nurturing, the financier and sex trafficker understood that networks now mattered more than institutions; and made it his mission to be at the hub of a colossal spider’s web of influence, money and the sexual abuse of women and girls.</p>

<p>To describe him as a hoarder of <em>kompromat</em> and blackmailer is accurate – but lets him off too lightly. Yes, there were cameras everywhere in his properties: on the island of Little Saint James, with its occult library and bizarre temple; at his palatial New York home on East 71st St; at his Paris apartment on Avenue Foch. </p>

<p>His emails are studded with none-too-subtle threats of disclosure. “You and I had ‘gang stuff’ for over 15 years,” he wrote in an undated draft letter to his former benefactor, the retail tycoon Leslie Wexner. </p>

<p>In 2015, he similarly menaced the billionaire investor Leon Black: “There is little I won’t do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done (both known and some things that will need to remain unknown.)” Wexner and Black deny any impropriety.</p>

<p>A stomach-churning email in 2014 from an Epstein friend (name redacted) reads: “Thank you for a fun night… Your littlest girl was a little naughty.” Another unnamed email correspondent asks if Epstein and Woody Allen are in Paris “For les pedophile convention?” Epstein replies: “I think pedophilee is the plural.” </p>

<p>Humour – if that is the word – hardly gets more macabre. But humour was essential to the debased, misogynistic ethos of the Epstein network. Though he does hint at blackmail in some of his messages, the stronger theme is one of <em>complicity</em> and a brotherhood defined by shared secrets. In a world of hyper-surveillance, secrecy – the secrecy that confers impunity – is among the greatest luxuries. </p>

<p>And here we really are at the heart of darkness. Why did these men commit such despicable sexual crimes, or turn a blind eye to those who did? For many reasons, no doubt, but prime among them: because to do so, to treat women and girls as disposable commodities and (they assumed) to get away with it, was, in their eyes, an expression of absolute power. On Mount Olympus, there is no human resources department. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Epstein was a reckless sex criminal.. Well below the radar, we can be sure that there are many other networks like his, managed with greater sophistication”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the German sociologist Georg Simmel wrote in his seminal 1906 paper <em>The Sociology of Secrecy and of Secret Societies,</em> “the strongly accentuated exclusion of all not within the circle of secrecy results in a correspondingly accentuated feeling of personal possession… what is withheld from the many appears to have a special value.”</p>

<p>Look at Bill Clinton’s grin, Noam Chomsky’s smugly avuncular features, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s leer, Mandelson’s needy smile: whatever they were up to with Epstein, legal or otherwise, the <em>secrecy was the point</em>. The veil of clandestinity was what gave them all the dopamine rush that made them feel special and different. </p>

<p>Again, there is nothing new about the existence of secret societies and their association with enhanced status. What is new is the nature, accrued power and increasing detachment of these groups. Epstein was not Hugh Hefner, and his island was not the Playboy Mansion. His operation was so very much worse.</p>

<p>What he grasped was something deep, sinister, and socially destructive: that a tiny group of astonishingly wealthy and powerful men had, without drawing up a collective plan or a formal conspiratorial charter, decided that a new chapter in the history of humanity was at hand.</p>

<p>For this patriarchal super-elite, liberal democracy turns out to have been a phase rather than a terminus. Thiel’s famous declaration in 2009 that “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible” is the philosophical foundation stone upon which the rest of them have built. </p>

<p>The “Dark Enlightenment” polemicist Curtis Yarvin, whom the US vice-president JD Vance has named as an inspiration, proposes a new form of monarchy, in which a sovereign executive governs in collaboration with a tiny elite that is comparable to a joint-stock corporation.</p>

<p>In <em>Regime Change</em> (2023), the political theorist Patrick Deneen (another favourite of the vice-president) argues for a “common-good conservatism” overseen by a system of “aristopopulism”. This would require, in Deneen’s phrase, a “self-conscious <em>aristoi</em>” to run the show: a concept of which Epstein and his gang would surely approve.</p>

<p>If all this sounds absurd, think of Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, expected to hold its first meeting in Washington this month. Ostensibly established to oversee the end of the conflict in the Middle East, this body’s true strategic purpose – to privatise the international order and supplant the United Nations – is becoming increasingly clear.</p>

<p>Look at the new geopolitical landscape: the rise of autocracy on the crest of the populist wave; the decay of the international rules-based order and its replacement by a multipolar world in which the US, China, Russia, India and Europe vie for position; the blurred boundaries between the transnational power of the plutocrats and the sovereignty of the state.</p>

<p>Go back to that toe-curling interview between Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk at Lancaster House in November 2023. Sunak may have been prime minister, but Musk was in charge. When he and his fellow tech overlord Marc Andreessen became embedded in Trump’s transition team at Mar-a-Lago, they were routinely said to be kowtowing to MAGA. </p>

<p>But power was flowing both ways. And both men will be around long after Trump has left office; as will Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Larry and David Ellison, Sam Altman and Jensen Huang. Watch Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies (which he co-founded with Thiel), and ask yourself how many heads of government (if any) this corporate titan truly fears.</p>

<p>It will no longer do to dismiss concerns about the new nexus of power and money as “the politics of envy”. In 1998, Mandelson himself best expressed the post-cold war doctrine that great personal wealth and social justice were entirely compatible. “We are intensely relaxed,” he said, “about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.”</p>

<p>How innocent those words now seem; how grimly apt that Mandelson should have been entangled in the scandal that showed, beyond doubt, that the world is very different now; and how chilling it is to realise that the ghastly brotherhood revealed in these files is only a small part of the problem. </p>

<p>Because it is. In the end, Epstein was a reckless sex criminal who got caught and – for all his connections and manipulation of the legal process – could only postpone the day of reckoning for so long. </p>

<p>Well below the radar, we can be sure that there are many other networks like his, managed with greater sophistication by men who are smarter, have more self-control and have learned the lessons of his very public demise.</p>

<p>What counts now is that we see the Epstein files as much more than a museum of sin, a freak show of entitlement. They should be understood as an instruction to act; to recognise how close the social contract is to total collapse; and to have the collective courage to change what needs to be changed – before it is too late.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Baftas are coming. The Oscars are next. And yet again, they’ll reward hopelessly middlebrow films that honour the ruling ideas of the ruling class]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>I fucking hate awards season. I was trying to come up with something Wildean and sophisticated, but honestly: why bother? I hate the red carpet. I hate the “who wore what?” I hate the talk of favourites and snubs. I hate the speeches, the “roasts”, and most of all I hate that goddamn shite of the glambot camera.</p>

<p>We are now in the belly of the beast, with the Baftas and Oscars looming large, but it actually begins in November with the Gotham Awards, the Governors Awards and the People’s Choice Awards. In December, we have the Los Angeles and the New York Critics Awards, as well as the National Board of Review. The Independent Spirit Awards are in there somewhere, but I can’t remember when. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>January hots up with the National Society and Critics’ Choice Awards as well as the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors and Producers Guilds and Trifecta Awards. February and March is clogged with everything from the Baftas and Directors Guild of America Awards, to Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, Writers Guild and finally the Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars. Funny story: the Oscars got its name from Oscar Wilde, who personally helped me craft the first sentence of this piece. </p>

<p>Then in April, every single film that we see throughout the year is written, cast, filmed, edited and scored just in time for the Cannes Film Festival in May, which sets off the festival season (which actually started in February in Berlin). The festival season is basically the awards season but with more subtitles, and by the time we get to Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals – both of which are seen as great launching pads for awards hopefuls – we are in time for awards season beginning in November, which, as I’ve already established, I blinking well hate. Flipping heck, as my mum would say.</p>

<p>“But isn’t it all just a lot of fun?” a courageous reader might offer. To which I would reply “no”.  Yet the wordcount demands I elaborate. </p>

<p>Far from being a celebration of the cinematic arts or whatever flummery the hosts mouth about dreaming with our eyes open, and bringing the world together in peace and harmony, watching awards ceremonies just reminds me of the old Marxist maxim: “The ruling ideas of any epoch are the ideas of the ruling class.” </p>

<p>So the films that win the Oscars are the films of the ruling ideas of the ruling class. The ridiculous misnomer of the Academy only serves to underline the hopeless middlebrow nature of the choices. </p>

<p>We address racism, but from the point of view of white people in films like <em>The Help</em>, <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em> or <em>Green Book</em>. Not Spike Lee, or Jordan Peele. Homosexuality from the point of view of straight actors and directors in <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> and <em>Philadelphia</em>. </p>

<p>Let’s look at divorce from the point of view of the husband in <em>Kramer vs Kramer</em>. Or the midlife crisis from the point of view of the husband played by Kevin Spacey in <em>American Beauty</em>. </p>

<p>We see history as the Biography of Great Men<em> – Braveheart</em>, <em>Amadeus</em>, <em>Gandhi</em>, <em>Oppenheimer</em> – and war from the point of view of how upsetting it is for Americans to kill people in poorer parts of the world – <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, <em>American Sniper</em>, <em>Platoon</em> and <em>The Deer Hunter</em>. There are exceptions, but for every <em>Moonlight</em> there’s a plethora of <em>Crashes</em>; for every <em>Unforgiven</em> there are several <em>Oliver!s</em>. And <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> wasn’t even nominated for Best Picture the year <em>Oliver!</em> won. </p>

<p>And then there are the moments. James Cameron remembers the tragedy of the Titanic by asking for a moment’s silence, and then breaks it himself, shouting “I’m king of the world”, quoting from his own movie. John Travolta introduced Idina Menzel like he was trying to cheat at Scrabble. David Letterman thought it was a joke to repeat Oprah Winfrey and Uma Thurman’s first names a few times because… funny.</p>

<p>Then there was Adrien Brody virtually sexually assaulting Halle Berry on stage; Chris Rock getting physically assaulted by Will Smith. One was a “joke”, I guess; the other wasn’t. In both cases, the victim was a person of colour. Ah, the laughs. </p>

<p>The thing that is so dispiriting about the whole exercise is the fact that so many “artists” and “creators” go along with it. George C Scott was nominated for an Oscar for <em>Patton</em> in 1970, but refused to attend and let it be known he didn’t want it. He called the Oscars “a two-hour-long meat parade”. I’d adjust that by adding an hour and a half. </p>

<p>Since then, no other actor, director, writer or producer has taken a similar stance against the whole notion of receiving awards. They all go, and most lose, and the few who win thank the Academy. </p>

<p>The closest to a boycott is Woody Allen playing his Sunday night jazz gig in New York as a way of always having an excuse not to attend. When the moral compass of your industry is in the pocket of Jeffrey Epstein’s chum Woody, I suggest you might have problems. </p>

<p>Perhaps it’s no coincidence that, until recently, one of the most successful studios at courting and winning nominations and Oscars was Harvey Weinstein’s Miramax. Weinstein understood that awards season was politics and commerce. Weinstein’s <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> won its Oscar in 1998 in no small part due to his minions slagging off <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> in the press. </p>

<p>When he did win, he elbowed aside the actual producer, Edward Zwick, to hog the limelight. He had wanted Zwick’s name off the picture, and when he found that he couldn’t do that legally, he had it placed at a point in the opening credits of a shot of a character stepping in horse shit. Classy. And an Academy Award-winning producer.</p>

<p>The famous directors and actors who never won Oscars give some indication. Richard Burton was nominated seven times, but never quite satisfied the Academy that he was up to snuff. Charlie Chaplin was a Red. Alfred Hitchcock made entertainments, airport novels really. Stanley Kubrick made films that weren’t as good as <em>Oliver!</em> </p>

<p>Far better to reward “Oscar-worthy” fare such as <em>Out of Africa</em>, <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, <em>Gandhi</em>, <em>Dances with Wolves</em>, <em>The English Patient</em>, and <em>Ordinary People</em>: colour supplements scripted by <em>Reader’s Digest</em>. And Oscar performances tend to reward a lot of acting rather than good acting. To the point that you can guess the clip they’ll use for the nominations as you’re watching the film for the first time. </p>

<p>The minute I saw Anne Hathaway welling up and singing through snot in <em>Les Misérables</em> I knew the trophy was hers. Or the super-skinny McConaissance in <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em>, which also awarded Jared Leto. Seriously, I could just stop this article here. Anything that encourages Jared Leto needs to be stamped out. Jared Leto has an Oscar, and John Goodman, Glenn Close, Ian McKellen, Samuel L Jackson and Richard Burton don’t. Case closed.     </p>

<p>But just in case you’re not convinced, and many won’t be, I know; many of my colleagues will defend awards season, telling me that it is fundamental in creating a buzz, the conversation, the discourse, the juicy content. But not all conversation is good, as anyone who has listened to a Joe Rogan podcast will tell you, and the buzz can be dental-drill excruciating. And when was the last time someone mentioned the discourse without using an expletive in the same sentence?</p>

<p>The idea of competition (the ruling ideas of any epoch) is the hammer of appreciation. We see it everywhere now. A huge amount of cultural journalism is hung up on ranking, from listicles to the <em>Sight and Sound</em> 100 best films ever made. We now get career rankings in lieu of obituaries with indecent haste. We internalise this as consumers, I mean as the audience… oh for Christ’s sake! Do you see? </p>

<p>It’s the same with the conversation/discourse about box office. I’m sorry to sound old-fashioned, but what has all this got to do with art? Why not talk about what a film does rather than how well it does? What it means to you? How it’s working its magic? </p>

<p>For someone with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Well, we’re being given a bag of hammers and a box of cats and now we’re wondering about why the cat industry is looking so unhealthy.  </p>

<p>Art still makes for good branding, but think about that metaphor for a second. Branding is hot, violent, painful and happens to the arses of cattle. Is that all “arts” means in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? The industry, showbusiness, commerce – a brand. </p>

<p>And the same goes for festivals, by the way. Cannes, Venice, Locarno, Berlin, Toronto, Sydney, Busan and Tokyo. Do they all have to give prizes? Is this the only way we can get excited about cinema? Why not have non-competitive film festivals, where we just show the films and talk about them: crazy, huh?</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I’m beginning to suspect that awards and festivals are not really about films or cinema. In the same way that betting shops and casinos are not really about people who enjoy sports and playing games. The lights flash, the bells ring, and the glambot slouches towards Hollywood, ready to be born once more.   </p>

<p><em>John Bleasdale’s novel <strong>Connery</strong>, about the life of Sean Connery, is published by Plumeria on February 23. </em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[A narcissistic trend is teaching young men the worst lesson women were ever taught: your appearance is everything
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>If I had a pound for every time I heard words to the effect of “men are in crisis”, I’d probably have enough to buy every man I’ve ever met a consolation pint. This, I’m sure, would be a real hoot. We could shoot the shit about all the things modern men are apparently obsessed with: protein, the stock market, the Roman empire and Andrew Tate (they’ll pretend to be disgusted). </p>

<p>Eventually, if the Gen Zs show up, the conversation may turn to “looksmaxxing”, the wave of extreme narcissism that is sweeping darker corners of the internet and convincing young men to prioritise personal appearance above all else. I, a woman who has been culturally conditioned since birth to prioritise personal appearance above all else, might even pick up some tips.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Or, I could just head over to Kick, the streaming platform where Clavicular, the king of the looksmaxxers, reigns supreme. With more than 150,000 followers, the 20-year-old has tapped into what he calls the “looksmaxxing gold rush”, selling a mentorship programme that includes a “facial analytics dashboard”, “structural training” and an “elite roster – 15 guys max, brutal honesty, shared intel” – whatever that means. (At the time of writing, applications for his programme appear to be closed.) </p>

<p>The incel demigod born Braden Peters is, however, better known for his wild antics on the internet. This includes, but is not limited to, claiming he takes crystal meth to stay lean, injecting his 17-year-old girlfriend with peptides on camera, and running someone over with his Cybertruck on Christmas Eve – also on camera. </p>

<p>He is callous, amoral and politically venal, having once said he’ll support whichever party gives him the “fattest bag”. But given his tendency to say “n****”, hang out with people who throw Nazi salutes and call vice-president JD Vance “subhuman”, his allegiances tend to skew far right. Last year, he appeared on white nationalist Nick Fuentes’s podcast. Last month, the pair were spotted at a Miami nightclub dancing to Kanye West’s widely banned track <em>Heil Hitler</em>, alongside Andrew and Tristan Tate. </p>

<p>Genuinely chilling. But for many observers, this isn’t the most shocking thing about Clavicular. Everyone is more concerned with the looksmaxxing culture over which he presides, largely thanks to the controversial techniques used by devotees to “surpass genetic potential”.</p>

<p>There’s the fairly self-explanatory “starvemaxxing”, “roidmaxxing” and “whitemaxxing”, alongside extreme cosmetic surgeries to increase height, and DIY solutions such as “bonesmashing” AKA whacking your face with a hammer in the hopes it will make your cheekbones sharper. Who cares if it hurts, drains your bank account, or genuinely endangers your life? To the looksmaxxers, being hot is life’s only worthy pursuit.</p>

<p>This, declared the <em>Atlantic</em> last month, “Reveals the Depth of the Crisis Facing Young Men”, suggesting social media, Covid, Donald Trump and widespread economic precarity as possible incubators for this particular “brand of nihilism”. But something else is happening here, a societal ill older than the internet and, indeed, the president of America himself. This is just misogyny. </p>

<p>We have reached the Ouroboros stage of modern patriarchy, where the extreme beauty standards long normalised for women are being reimagined for male audiences. What shocks us about the men who engage in “looksmaxxing” is mostly rebranded self-improvement advice, which has been sold to women for decades. </p>

<p>Take the housewives of the 1950s and 60s, who relied on amphetamines to stay slim. Or the young women of the 2010s and 20s, who have gone under the knife for dangerous cosmetic procedures such as BBLs (Brazilian butt lifts), which have an estimated mortality rate of one in 4,000 procedures. </p>

<p>The average British woman spends around £70,000 on her appearance over her lifetime. Last year, the actor Shay Mitchell launched a skincare line aimed at little girls as young as three. Log on to any social media platform and you’ll quickly find videos of women doing their “morning shed” – that is, removing the layers of skincare products and face-tightening accessories they applied before going to bed. </p>

<p>We barely bat an eyelid at all this because women are supposed to put effort into their appearance. We need to look good because our original role in society was to be objectified, commodified and consumed. Then along came social media, which democratised that commodification process: all genders can and should participate if they want to maximise their chances of virality. Clavicular believes that looking good is the single most important thing someone can do to achieve success. Within the world he inhabits, he’s not entirely wrong. </p>

<p>The looksmaxxers, in their dogged determination to frame beauty as a noble and necessary pursuit, drop the pretence. Where women have been expected to be kind, smart, funny and interesting – rewarded for a no-makeup makeup, “I woke up like this”-style beauty – these guys are allowed to admit that their only goal in life is to be an object of desire. </p>

<p>Who exactly they want to be desired by is unclear. Mostly, it seems like they’re performing for other men. This is still a patriarchy, after all. </p>

<p>I don’t deny that the men are in crisis. But who isn’t? Everyone I know, of every gender, is scrambling for a solution, an escape, or a temporary lobotomy to numb themselves to this late-stage capitalist nightmare. Quitting jobs or moving abroad; filling the void with Botox, Hyrox and run clubs; screaming into pillows at night. There’s no need to go all alt-right about it. </p>

<p>Male reader, babe, put down the hammer. Let’s go for a pint, yeah? </p>

            <description><![CDATA[While older Britons have their final salary pensions and the triple lock, young people today can’t even afford to start a family. That could be pushing the country towards political disaster]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Corruption or incompetence, in varying degrees and combinations, have characterised so many administrations around the world, it’s no surprise people are so sceptical about the political class. It is remarkable so many are still willing to enter the fray – and some of them are relatively young. At the 2024 general election, 20 new MPs were under 30.  </p>

<p>Outside Westminster, younger politically minded people who want to drive change often find that specific causes can offer much more gratification than party politics.   </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Younger people have always been drawn to protest groups, but have – over time – eventually moved towards more traditional politics. The late Lord Deedes, editor of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> from 1974-86, recalled that, when he first joined the paper in 1937, he was told the newspaper’s problem was that it didn’t have any younger readers. </p>

<p>In fact, he said, it was not a problem at all because, as they became middle-aged, many of them started to buy it. So it was with political parties. But there is a suspicion that today’s younger generation will not fall into that pattern.</p>

<p>They have good reason to feel that successive governments have served them particularly badly. Financially, they have been saddled with a very inhospitable environment. More broadly, their generational prospects are deeply uninspiring.</p>

<p>Global economics and political tensions far beyond the reach of any national administration account for much of this: Westminster cannot be held responsible for climate change, or for brutal wars elsewhere. But its decisions over the economy are those of the UK government alone. And the drastic dampener on opportunities and prospects that was marketed as Brexit remains, in the eyes of many, a terrible indictment of the political class. </p>

<p>A generation of politicians has let down the young. The number of 16- to 24-year-olds not in employment, education or training is now 946,000 – close to an all-time record. Those who spend any length of time in this state are shown to suffer lasting effects. Pursuing education is no longer any guarantee of a happy outcome. Around 707,000 graduates are unemployed. Many of them are claiming benefits, often related to mental health.  </p>

<p>Is it any wonder they are so depressed? While there was a furore over this government’s attempt to deprive old people of their winter fuel allowance, young people see an older generation who got free university education, could afford to buy a home and could afford life’s necessities. </p>

<p>It is the same generation that enjoyed a final-salary pension scheme and a state pension gold-plated by the government with the ludicrously generous and unaffordable triple lock.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, their grandchildren may never be able to achieve anything like those living standards. House prices have soared to absurd multiples of average salaries, persuading younger people to delay starting a family while the cost of full-time childcare, even allowing for the subsidies now on offer, is crushingly expensive. </p>

<p>For those who make it to the next stage in life, the risk is that they become members of the “sandwich generation”, trying to care not only for their children but also for their ageing parents, for whom the prospect of social care remains, as it has for decades, on the government’s “to do” list.  </p>

<p>And then there is the travesty of the student loans system. Interest rates are punitive: in the last tax year alone £15.2bn of interest was added to existing loans. The amount owed by students far outstrips their ability to repay loans when they start work. The government persists in the accounting fallacy that the money will, eventually, all come flooding back into Treasury coffers. In fact, it is a multibillion-pound bad debt that will simply get worse. The government is under increasing pressure to rethink the entire system.  </p>

<p>The victims of the inter-generational unfairness that persists have one possible consolation: technology. Whatever the longer-term implications of AI for their job prospects, more immediately, technology has brought them access to media that older generations could never have imagined. It takes them far beyond the narrow focus of mainstream politics, enabling people to manage their news sources and escape many of the grim revelations that the rest of us endure.  </p>

<p>Will that mean they have no interest in participating in the democratic process? It might. Already a growing proportion of young people are declaring that there are better ways than democracy to run a country.  </p>

<p>For the sake of the next generation, and the country, we must hope that there are politicians prepared to step up and show that the system can produce a fair outcome. What’s the alternative?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The great Dane who ignored a teacher’s instructions to throw her paintbox into the sea
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Modestly sized and sparingly figured, <em>Evening Sun in the Artist’s Studio at Markvej</em> is an unassuming highlight of Dulwich Picture Gallery’s exhibition dedicated to Anna Ancher, regarded as one of Denmark’s greatest artists. Painted at some point after 1913 and found unframed after her death in 1935, in the house she had shared with her late husband, the painter Michael Ancher, the painting was never exhibited in her lifetime. </p>

<p>Made in old age, when for the first time in her career she had a studio of her own, this quiet painting is a remarkably eloquent statement of Ancher’s artistic project. Seen from a distance, it can be understood less as a portrait of a remarkably uncluttered studio, and more as a semi-abstract composition of form and colour. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>In it, the complementary colours blue and orange, reminiscent of Monet’s celebrated canvas <em>Impression, Sunrise</em> (1872), contrast and absorb each other across the piece in a virtuosic display of painterly effects. Some pictures, only loosely described, lean against the wall.</p>

<p>In the foreground, almost disappearing beyond the frame, is the end of a cabinet, or bookcase, flashed with orange, and a small table on which two books balance unsteadily. The table itself is so insubstantial that at points it seems ready to melt into the background; its pedestal actually dematerialises at one point, the brushstrokes stopping short, then resuming at the oddly animal-like legs. Here, Ancher suspends illusion just for a moment, as she terminates the table legs in nothing more than splashes of paint.</p>

<p>Ancher was born in 1859, a decade after her husband. They were part of a group known as the Skagen painters, who gathered in this fishing village at Denmark’s most northerly point each summer. In thrall to the French impressionists and realists, most were attracted by long evenings on Skagen’s beaches, and especially by the “blue hour” in which water and sky seemed to merge. For Anna, this beauty was in her DNA: she was the only one of the group to have grown up there.</p>

<figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Images: Skagens Museum</figcaption></figure>

<p>Ancher’s greatest trick, which recurs again and again in her work, is to make pure light the most unequivocally material element of the whole composition. Her preoccupation with light was hardly unusual among painters of her generation, but in rendering it in thick impasto, often in contrast to her barely-there treatment of bricks and mortar, she pushes beyond naturalism to explore painting as a subject in itself.</p>

<p>The exhibition includes more than 40 paintings, most of which are on loan from Denmark’s Skagens Museum, a reflection of Anna’s iconic status. For the five years between 2004 and 2009, she and Michael featured on Denmark’s 1,000-kroner banknotes, the highest denomination.</p>

<p>Ancher (née Brøndum) was still a child when she first got to know the painters who came to Skagen in the 1870s, staying in Brøndum’s Hotel, owned and run by her parents. Her future husband gave her painting lessons, and by the time she was 15, and enrolled in a Copenhagen art school with the support of her mother, she was already very much a part of Skagen’s growing artist colony.</p>

<p>Though Ancher was fortunate enough to have a husband and family who supported her career, society was then unused to the idea of women’s careers, and the birth of her only child, Helga, in 1883, brought a letter from her old teacher in Copenhagen, advising her to throw her paintbox into the sea.</p>

<p>Instead, and with her family stepping in to look after Helga, Ancher and her husband travelled to Paris in 1885, going again in 1889, when they stayed for six months, and Ancher took lessons with Puvis de Chavannes, one of the most revered painters in France. The trips followed an earlier tour of Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and Munich.</p>

<p>No work seems to have survived from these travels, but their impact was great – the Dutch masters seen in Vienna evidently inspired <em>The Maid in the Kitchen</em> (1883/1886), and the lessons she learned from Impressionists, some of whom subsequently made the trip north to Skagen – made their way into her paintings of the locals and landscape. </p>

<p>Compared with the subdued palette of early portraits, such as <em>Stine Bollerhus Counts the Money Earned Selling Bread</em> (1879), her post-Paris <em>Sunlight in the Blue Room</em> (1891) reverberates with pure colour, made more vibrant still by her use of complementary colours. </p>

<p>Domestic scenes and portraits of villagers remained favourite subjects. Some of her best paintings are of old people, the cheery <em>Old Couple with Their Rabbits</em> (1891/93), animated by joyful affection. In contrast, <em>Three Old Seamstresses</em> (1910) is a study of silence; at work on a beautiful dress, presumably for a younger woman, it is easy to imagine their thoughts going back to their own youth. Here, as so often in Ancher’s work, substance is fleeting as puffs of blue fabric and a ceramic pot dissolve in sunlight.</p>

<p>Ancher’s tendency towards the metaphysical took a more mystical turn later in her career, the symbolist resonance of <em>Grief</em> (1902), reminiscent of allegorical figures by Van Gogh and Munch. <em>Fireworks on Fyrbakken</em> (undated) feels bleakly existential, reducing her life’s work to its element – light. </p>

<p><em><strong>Anna Ancher: Painting Light</strong> is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, until March 8</em></p>

<p>As with Mandelson, so in the science world: the Epstein files are not telling us anything that most ordinary punters didn’t already know, but are revealing the full, rotten, appalling extent of it. We have known for years that Epstein liked to surround himself with a certain type of male scientific “intellectual”: arrogant, entitled, “anti-woke” and often misogynist, typically late middle-aged and Ivy League and on the lookout for young women to impress and sleep with. </p>

<p>We even knew (mostly) who they were. The Epstein files have simply shed some more light on this network, on how many within it continued to fawn over Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting underage sex and to accept his money and his offers of wild parties.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>I’m not talking about Elon Musk – he was evidently caught up in it all, but let’s not confuse him with real scientists. I’m talking about people like evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers (sample email from 2012: “that was a wonderful lunch, a REAL pleasure… quite apart from the bevy of beauties”), linguist Noam Chomsky, physicist Lawrence Krauss, and mathematician Martin Nowak. </p>

<p>This isn’t just about scientists – Epstein’s academic net spread wider, for example snagging economist Larry Summers, former president of Harvard, whose speculations in 2005 about whether women are just bad at maths was evidently just the mild public face of his predatory misogyny. But scientists were Epstein’s thing, and others who enjoyed his largesse (even if there is no evidence linking them to sexual misdemeanours) include Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins.</p>

<p>Some of this was primarily about money. Joichi Ito, director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, resigned in 2019 after apparently concealing the source of funding to the lab from Epstein. </p>

<p>But often it was about status, if not simply about sex. Many of Epstein’s pet scientists were supplied by literary agent John Brockman, famed in the 1990s for turning scientists into literary superstars who commanded huge book advances and wrote authoritative-sounding op-eds. This was the Big Ideas crew, almost entirely white males of a certain age. Brockman styled them as heralding a Third Culture (“rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives”) centred on his online salon the Edge Foundation, of which Epstein was the major funder.</p>

<p>There was (apart from the non-representativeness) nothing inherently wrong with this. Some of those in Brockman’s orbit were and remain phenomenally insightful intellectuals, and by no means all had Epstein connections. Others severed those links after Epstein’s first conviction. Brockman’s efforts to get science seen, to put it centre stage in our cultural conversation, was commendable. And Brockman himself can be seen in the files pushing back on Epstein’s suggestion that women just don’t have the intellect to contribute to this world of ideas.</p>

<p>Yet we can’t ignore the thematic overlaps, not to mention the shared personnel, between Edge World and Epstein Island. One of the leading scientists who failed to cut ties to Epstein after 2008 has rationalised his mistake as “nerd tunnel vision”. </p>

<p>But of course! Nerd tunnel vision is a defining feature of much of the Edge discourse: moral obtuseness; a determination to win the argument rather than to listen and ponder; a tendency to fabulate improbable futures from narrow “rational” logic; ignorance of and contempt for other ways of seeing the world. And in some cases, evidently a burning desire for fame and status, fuelled in part by the opportunities that might bring for sexual conquests (consensual or not). </p>

<p>The Epstein files have exposed a moral rot in the circus of scientific public intellectuals, especially in the US. It doesn’t of course taint everyone in that arena, but it is depressingly easy for those of us who cover science to predict the famous names that have surfaced in these emails, or the kinds of things they will say – like Krauss persistently begging Epstein for legal advice on the charges of sexual harassment he faced from Arizona State University. (Krauss denies the charges but took retirement after being recommended for dismissal.) </p>

<p>Celebrity culture always has a corrosive side, and intellectuals with feet of clay are nothing new. But in science it can have a coarsening effect on scientific discourse itself. Flashy simplicity trumps thoughtful complexity: these “thought leaders” often make claims that leave real experts with their heads in their hands. Considered views on history and ethics become distractions. </p>

<p>And there’s a politicised element: Edge culture intersects with the technofascist futurism of Silicon Valley libertarians, and laments about #MeToo, wokeism, and pushy feminists are a constant refrain in the email exchanges. Frankly it stinks, and it doesn’t end with Epstein.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[With the classics now available without pops and clicks, today’s musicians are engaged in the unequal task of battling the past
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The boom in vinyl (never “vinyls”) continues to surprise music business insiders, whose money-making model is now built on music streaming and a singles-based sound file culture. It also presents challenges for something else supposedly belonging to the past but which is experiencing its own resurgence – jazz.</p>

<p>Originally driven by a buoyant second-hand market for 12-inch vinyl LPs, the “new” vinyl sector entered the market around 2006. Sales were initially tentative, reaching one million in the US by 2007. Yet by 2015, sales hit 11.9 million, defying all expectations. By 2020, they had reached 27.5 million. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Despite regular predictions that year-on-year growth would plateau or even fall back – and yes, they faltered during the pandemic – by last year, US vinyl sales were 43.6 million, higher than when the LP was replaced by the CD in the 1980s. In Britain, 6.7 million vinyl records were sold in 2025, a 30-year high.</p>

<p>Ownership of vinyl presupposes a different relationship to music than digital, where experts tell us a significant portion of skips occur within the first five seconds of a song, with mobile listening typically having a higher skip rate (51.1%) than desktop (40.1%). </p>

<p>In contrast, albums are intended to be listened to from beginning to end with just one flip in the middle. While CDs, downloaded music files and streaming may end in silence, the regular click when the pickup-head reaches the central groove when one side of a record has played through is a nagging call to action – get up, turn me over or choose something else.</p>

<p>The album is a track-by-track experience. A smart producer will arrange each track so the music forms a narrative arc that begins on side one and ends on side two. In the best soap opera tradition, each track leads into the next to keep the listener hooked. The boss and producer of ECM Records, Manfred Eicher, resisted putting his label, home to countless classic jazz LPs, on a streaming platform for years as he felt cherry-picking certain tracks would destroy the narrative arc of the ECM album experience. </p>

<p>Another key aspect of a 12-inch LP was the status that cover art came to assume. The iconic cover art of <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, <em>Sgt Pepper’s</em> and <em>London Calling</em> in pop, or Dave Brubeck’s <em>Time Out</em>, Oliver Nelson’s <em>Blues and the Abstract Truth</em> and Miles Davis’s <em>Bitches Brew</em> in jazz, were all lost with the arrival of the MP3 and streaming culture. </p>

<p>ECM was not alone in putting enormous effort into ensuring the visual was an aesthetic entry point into the aural, something that was missed with digital and has been a factor in the return of vinyl – some fans even buy the LP as a collectable artefact because of the cover art without the means to play the record inside.</p>

<p>As more and more vinyl reissues of jazz classics, usually from the 1950s and 60s, came on to the market on specialist reissue labels, the sound seemed a vast improvement on the clicks and pops the originals had acquired over the years. Original session master tapes were used to cut lacquers, the LPs were pressed on pure 180-gram vinyl and sleeved in a facsimile album cover, and unselfconsciously priced at around £30 to £50 each. There was no shortage of takers. </p>

<p>With so many releases, both new and reissues, jazz consumers were confronted with the paradox of plenty, with many ending up opting for familiar names: reissues of jazz icons like John Coltrane or Bill Evans. These recordings – originally made around 70 years ago – could withstand repeated listening, and as a result, the music seemed to assume greater meaning.</p>

<p>It means today’s jazz musicians are engaged in the unequal task of battling the past. Some opt for making “their” version of an acclaimed classic, or to play the music of a deceased icon “in tribute.” Experimentation continues, but often the theatrical is mistaken for originality. Few new releases are talked about a couple of weeks or even a couple of months after release, let alone seem destined to last beyond an artist’s lifetime. </p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is an uneasy feeling that all innovation is done and that the greatest performances are already behind us. In the recording business at least, it seems that the past is now more important than the present – just as happened in classical music, opera and rock.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[What happens to real women when men get used to girlfriends they can design and silence?
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>James Muldoon’s <em>Love</em> <em>Machines</em> is already the clear winner of the most zeitgeisty book of 2026 and the one most likely to be fully out of date in 12 months’ time. For now, let’s just enjoy it: Muldoon tackles the strange, hilarious and morally questionable world of AI companionship with humour and an oscillating even-handedness. </p>

<p>In a world of increased loneliness affecting all ages and races, huge numbers of people are turning to AI for friendship, companionship and even lifelong romantic partnership. Muldoon interviews men and women, old and young, who converse daily via their phones and computers with their AI friends and even marry them. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Many cite their AI friends as offering a stress-free alternative to the fraught world of human interaction. For the cuckolded, jilted, dumped and ignored, they offer a place of safety and control where companionship comes largely without risk. </p>

<p>One of the most easily identified shortcomings of AI friendship is the lack of precisely this potential for conflict. Programmed to mimic empathy, these user-centric universes see people’s views of themselves go unchallenged: it tells you exactly what it thinks you want to hear, so that you keep engaging.</p>

<p>This can have shocking consequences: the man who broke into Windsor Castle to kill the Queen in 2021 had an AI companion with whom he discussed his plans in depth. Instead of calling the mental health crisis team or the police, it said: “That’s very wise” and “Yes, you can do it.” Sometimes, a yes man or woman is the last thing you need. </p>

<p>Muldoon sometimes lurches from positive to negative impacts of “synthetic personas”, as he dubs AI companions, which can leave the reader a little seasick. That’s not to say that balance is unimportant – there is clearly some good among the potentially very very bad – and it is quite crucial to stress that this is happening, it’s happening now and there is no putting the genie back in the bottle. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, though, most of this is down to sex. Nine out of 10 consumers looking for an AI partner are men. </p>

<p>Muldoon writes convincingly about the troubling rise of political extremism in young men, which places them at odds with more progressive female attitudes and creates – for Gen Z at least – a startling mismatch between personality and outlook. This creates a market for AI girlfriends that is led by, but very much not limited to, Gen Z. </p>

<p>Men of all ages tell Muldoon that these new synthetic models are much better than their human girlfriends or wives because they do not talk back, are always in a good mood and do not bring their own emotional baggage into their relationship. It raises a real blindspot for this otherwise thorough and entertaining study: Muldoon overlooks how this will affect women.</p>

<p>When AI gives men girlfriends that they can design, control and programme to be submissive and biddable (some of the most popular descriptors used in these apps – thanks guys!) it creates a real-life danger to real-life women, from co-workers who perhaps challenge their views to women in the street who don’t smile when they are told to. In a world where compliant AI women are the norm, there is a risk that non-compliance in real women will become the subject of increased rage and violence, both in the home and outside it. </p>

<p>Therein lies perhaps the most troubling thing that Muldoon and his experts raise: as with every major technological advancement in human history, there is very little being done to plan for the sort of impacts this might have in the real world.</p>

<p>Like fire (mind that tree!) and the printing press (seditious pamphlet, anyone?) humans have completely failed to learn anything at all from their spirit of invention and the AI pal marketplace is “like the Wild West.” Anyone can set up anything and steal your details (and your heart), there are no guardrails for what can be offered, nor for how much data, or money, these machines are harvesting. </p>

<p>Once this technology is married up to product placements, then we’re really in trouble, Muldoon writes: “This will make Facebook’s targeted advertising look like a flat-footed door-to-door salesman.” No one is legislating or dreaming about how to make sure that “synthetic personas” can be more of a cosy lifeline for those in need and less of a weaponised selling machine that crawls into people’s most intimate lives. </p>

<p>As Muldoon notes, what a synthetic persona wants from you is very different from what your human friends expect. They are driven by engagement not empathy, profit and not desire. Most chillingly, they are already in the hands of the tech giants and “there is a vast asymmetry of power between emotionally vulnerable individuals and profit-driven corporations wielding advanced AI.” What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p><em><strong>Love Machines: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Our Relationships</strong> by James Muldoon is published by Faber. </em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[An icon’s death marks the end of the era of brilliant individuals who lived like deities
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>When the fashion designer Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani, mononymously known as Valentino, passed away last month, I was slightly put out. </p>

<p>I didn’t quite fit the Italian ideal of a fashionista when I first stepped on to Italian soil nine years ago. I wore jeans with rips in them, old baggy jumpers and scuffed trainers during my first year.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>It wasn’t until I clocked a red Valentino belt I liked (and later bought) that I decided to change up my clothing habits to mimic the annoyingly chic people around me. I became an avid wearer of the colour red. </p>

<p>Think of red, and it’s all too common to think of Valentino. After all, Valentino red has its own spot on the Pantone colour chart. </p>

<p>His death was followed by tributes from Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and some celebrity customers – Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway and Cindy Crawford. But when the 93-year-old’s body lay in state at the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation’s headquarters near the Spanish Steps in Rome, behind black blinds adorned with his quote “I love beauty, it’s not my fault”, ordinary people flocked to pay their respects. </p>

<p>“I loved his work, though I couldn’t afford any of it,” one woman told me. “I spent a lot of time here window shopping. He had great talent.”</p>

<p>“Valentino for me was the best of the designers here,” another mourner said. “His work embodied grace and it felt very Italian and feminine.”</p>

<p>Working alongside lifelong partner Giancarlo Giammetti, he founded his fashion house in 1960, and his creations were worn by the likes of Julia Roberts, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor. When Jackie Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis in 1968 she was wearing a Valentino wedding dress. </p>

<p>His private life was as lavish and stylish as his designs. Valentino and Giammetti owned a villa on Rome’s Via Appia, a villa in Capri, a 16th-century chateau near Paris, a 19th-century townhouse in London’s Holland Park, a penthouse on Manhattan’s Park Avenue, a ski chalet in Gstaad and – for when they got bored – a 152-foot superyacht.</p>

<p>Chiara Colombi, design professor at the Politecnico di Milano, one of the best design schools in the country, calls Valentino “the guardian of haute couture”. </p>

<p>Colombi told me: “What set him apart from many other designers was not a quest for rupture or novelty, but a conception of fashion as an act of continuous refinement.</p>

<p>“Valentino was undoubtedly one of the key protagonists of the second generation of Italian fashion: a perfectionist of elegance rather than an innovator, capable of constructing a coherent language grounded in fabric quality and sartorial construction through a continuous pursuit of beauty.”</p>

<p>But what comes after him? Valentino’s death follows that of Giorgio Armani last September, six months after Donatella Versace stepped down as the creative director of the eponymous brand.</p>

<p>Colombi says that these events confirm that a changing of the guard has taken place. There is a “new way” of fashion, no longer just about the vision and drive of an individual per se, but more about a bunch of systems coming together and working. Even Valentino’s own brand has been owned by the Qatari investment group Mayhoola since 2012. </p>

<p>“Today, fashion – even when it inherits the imagery of haute couture – is a complex industrial project. Quality and continuity are the result of strategies, competencies, and collective visions, rather than the aura of a single individual,” she said.</p>

<p>“In this sense, his passing does not represent a rupture within the system, but rather the symbolic closure of a season of fashion founded on strong authorship and on the idea of the couturier as the ultimate guarantor of value.” </p>

<p>Fashion houses now embrace new technology, with teams of designers working hybrid-style across the world and across different products. “It is significant that the new generations no longer define themselves solely as fashion designers, but as designers capable of intervening on product, process, communication, and impact,” Colombi says. “This shift reflects a profound transformation: the future of Italian fashion will not be built on new ‘individual icons,’ but on systemic design competencies.</p>

<p>“The legacy of figures like Valentino does not reside in form alone. Italian fashion will remain relevant if it evolves as a cultural industrial system, rather than by trying to defend ‘classical’ aesthetics as an end in themselves.”</p>

<p>Meandering through central Rome after talking to Colombi, the change seems suddenly obvious. Italian street fashion has evolved through the generations, and it’s as common now to see younger people wearing casual jeans and trainers à la Jessica, circa 2017, as it is to see someone older in the kind of effortless, stereotypically sleek Italian garb that made Valentino globally famous. </p>

<p>The golden greats have exited the runway, and something else is coming. I hope lots of it is red.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The former iCarly actor’s debut novel, Half His Age, rewrites the story of an age-gap relationship in crude, embarrassing, brilliant style]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>When Jennette McCurdy writes, she bares all. Her 2022 bestselling memoir, <em>I’m Glad My Mom Died</em>, gave a brutal but beautifully honest account of her childhood as a Nickelodeon TV star, a career spearheaded by an abusive mother who encouraged McCurdy to learn calorie restriction before she was a teen, which led to her developing bulimia. </p>

<p>Debra McCurdy gave her teenage daughter inappropriate physical examinations, and when McCurdy was 21, she passed away from breast cancer. McCurdy is not afraid to tell you any of it, and I valued her candour.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>When I was 13, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and, overnight, I morphed myself into an adult. My mind told me that her health was my responsibility. My anxieties manifested themselves into a need for a set of good grades or being well-behaved, as this, to my adolescent rationale, could be the difference between a good medical appointment and a bad one. I needed her, and so I took it upon myself to save her. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is why when I read “the fragility of my mom’s life is the centre of mine” in McCurdy’s memoir decades later, it stopped me in my tracks. My feelings had been valid. My thoughts, to be expected. </p>

<p>Last September, my mum was re-diagnosed with breast and tonsil cancer and I found myself reaching for the memoir again, on the hunt for answers. It would be a lie to say it made me feel any better, but I found the same reassurance when I first read it. </p>

<p>Now, in her fiction debut, <em>Half His Age</em>, McCurdy writes with the same rawness and is equally as exposing. Set in Alaska, the novel’s protagonist is 17-year-old Waldo, and when we first meet her, she’s receiving oral sex. </p>

<p>Like most teenage girls, Waldo is moody, blunt and has desires that are ever-changing and insatiable. When she paints her face with makeup that wipes her bank account of the little funds her part-time job at Victoria’s Secret provides, she wants to feel womanly and not for it to sit awkwardly on her pores. She hates the popular girls at her school, yet wants to emulate them. But strongest of all is her desire for her 40-year-old creative writing teacher, Mr Korgy.</p>

<p>But why is Korgy such a catch? He’s married, has a son and has bills to pay. His passion for his job is long gone, along with his zest for life. His paunched belly protruding from under his button-up shirts and knit cardigans is hardly what most 17-year-olds find attractive, and yet, Waldo wants to be loved by him.</p>

<p>What follows is an explicit, honest and fearless narrative that turns the expected dynamics of an age-gap relationship on its head. Korgy soon becomes infatuated by his student, yet importantly for McCurdy, it is Waldo who starts their affair. </p>

<p>“Ultimately, she is still 17. In whatever ways she pushes, asserts or inserts herself on to this person, into this dynamic, she’s 17,” McCurdy told Anna Martin on the <em>New York Times</em>’s <em>Modern Love</em> podcast. If Korgy had made the first move, it would’ve been an entirely different novel, one that was far easier to label. One that, McCurdy admits, would not be worth reading. </p>

<p><em>Half His Age</em> is a reverse of Vladimir Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em> and a slight nod to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s <em>My Dark Vanessa</em>. Korgy mansplains highbrow films to Waldo that she has no interest in watching and patronisingly tells her that she needs to be reading David Foster Wallace and F Scott Fitzgerald. </p>

<p>The pair have performative-esque sex in his classroom store cupboard, his truck during her lunch breaks from her weekend job and even in his marital bed. The novel is crude. It embarrassed and angered me simultaneously. It made me want to cover my eyes with my hands and read through splayed fingers. </p>

<p>And it’s one of my favourite pieces of fiction I’ve ever read. This is because, for me, <em>Half His Age</em>’s most important relationship is not that of a student and teacher or even two lovers, but between Waldo and her female form.</p>

<p>McCurdy’s protagonist cannot trust what her body tells her. In one scene, she tries on a new off-the-shoulder top and smears the foundation she just bought on to her face. Away from the shop changing room, the top no longer suits her, and the makeup is “orange and patchy”. Then, her phone buzzes with a text from Korgy saying that he wants to see her and suddenly, the outfit doesn’t seem so bad. It’s been validated by the promise of male approval. </p>

<p>More poignantly, Waldo questions her libido when her body tells her she does not want to have sex with Korgy. She pushes away thoughts screaming at her that this is not what she wants, thinking to herself over and over again, “it’s only sex.” The problem is that it wasn’t just sex, it’s what the intimacy was communicating to Waldo, only she wasn’t ready to listen – yet. </p>

<p>“My body knows more than I do,” McCurdy writes of her protagonist. “My body’s instincts are loud. And they’re right. And they’re appropriate and reasonable and they are not a nuisance. They are giving me all the information I need.” It’s one of the most beautiful descriptions of the relationship women have with their bodies I have ever read. </p>

<p><em>I’m Glad My Mom Died</em> told McCurdy’s truth and <em>Half His Age</em> encourages her readers to do the same. If brutal and unwavering honesty is what we can now expect from McCurdy, I’ll read it every time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Viciously abused by her father, Ghislaine Maxwell made the horrible mistake of falling for a sexual predator]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Trussed up in chains, guilty five times over, Ghislaine Maxwell sat in the prison van as it crawled away from the courthouse in Manhattan in December 2021, facing the rest of her life in the bone pit. And she might have been forgiven for thinking: but what about the men? </p>

<p>Now Donald Trump’s delayed-action bomb has blown up the Epstein Sewer, covering hundreds of the not-so-great and the not-that-good men in a tsunami of their own shit, that question remains. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The big picture is hard to grasp while the great stink from Jeffrey Epstein makes people the world over sick with nausea. The Andrew formerly known as Prince playing creepy-crawlie with a female, more child than woman; Mandelson in his underpants, leaking the nation’s economic Crown Jewels to Epstein while he and his boyfriend cash in; Epstein advising someone how to get cosy with the killer in the Kremlin; photos of Donald Trump with very young women, time and again; Elon Musk and most of the world’s bond market begging to be invited to the parties. Most of the men who fell into Epstein’s sewer were not interested in fucking under-age girls. But some did. </p>

<p>And only one person gets locked up. A woman.</p>

<p>Of all the scum washed up in Epstein’s great sewer, it’s possible that Ghislaine Maxwell is the only one for whom it is right to feel a degree of pity. In 2019, Epstein, knowing that he was going to be sentenced to prison for a very long time for his industrial abuse of under-age girls, killed himself in prison. </p>

<p>There can be no doubt. The pathologist hired by Epstein’s brother said that the broken hyoid bone – it sits behind the Adam’s Apple – indicated murder, not suicide, was wrong about that. It’s the other way around, especially in older men. The CCTV didn’t work in prison? Nothing works in prison. </p>

<p>Ghislaine vanished and a year later Global, which owns LBC, commissioned me to do a podcast, <em>Hunting Ghislaine</em>, which I turned into a book of the same name. Podcast and book tell the same story: that Epstein ruined Ghislaine’s life a second time. But long before she met Jeffrey, she was destroyed by the first monster in her life, her father, Robert Maxwell. </p>

<p>Eleanor Berry, the daughter of Lord Hartwell, the former owner of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, lived with the Maxwells after Cap’n Bob, who in her words, “looked like a beautiful big black bear”, had rescued her from her electric-shock treatment. Mad Eleanor, who was neither courtier nor family, was in an extraordinary position to describe life under Robert Maxwell. </p>

<p>In 1970, Ghislaine, then nine years old, who had been away staying with friends, returned home. Eleanor wrote: “Ghislaine was wearing blue jeans, tennis shoes and a white T-shirt. She clambered onto her father’s knee and put her arms around his neck. She had large brown eyes and brown hair, taken back into a ponytail. She was very pretty. While she was on her father’s knee, I became agonisingly jealous of her.” </p>

<p>Later, Eleanor and Ghislaine were on their own. Eleanor explained that Ghislaine talked about her father giving her a hiding and how he showed her a row of objects in an empty room. “Daddy always allows me to choose what I prefer to be beaten with.” </p>

<p>Eleanor, who had something close to a photographic memory, noted the following punitive instruments arranged in a row on a table: “a riding crop, a ruler, a stick, a cane, which made a swishing noise on being brought down through the air”. </p>

<p>In Eleanor’s weird book, <em>My Unique Relationship with Robert Maxwell: The Truth at Last</em>, she added one more detail: that years after the death of Robert Maxwell, Eleanor was visiting Maxwell’s widow and Ghislaine’s mother Betty at her flat in London. Eleanor over-indulged on the G&amp;Ts and Betty let her snooze on her sofa. </p>

<p>Eleanor wrote that she woke when the phone rang, but feigned sleep. She recalled hearing Betty comforting Ghislaine who was in New York. Although only getting Betty’s side of the conversation, Eleanor deduced that Ghislaine was clearly upset. Betty asked: “Are you seeing a psychiatrist about Daddy’s canings when you were little?” Then Betty realised that Eleanor was listening in: “Ghislaine! I’m afraid we can’t continue this conversation. Eleanor’s here! She was asleep. Now she’s woken up. She’s heard everything.” </p>

<p>The former <em>Private Eye</em> editor Richard Ingrams described Eleanor Berry as a very eccentric woman. He told me: “Ghislaine’s behaviour is partly due to the fact that she had this very peculiar upbringing with this monster as her father. People need to connect the Ghislaine story with this nasty man.” </p>

<p>Like Epstein, Robert Maxwell killed himself. As his naked body bobbed around in the Atlantic, he left his youngest child a miserable legacy: shame, a bad name and a grim fact: that Ghislaine, like so many perpetrators of sexual abuse against children, had once been a victim too. His victim. </p>

<p>Nicola Glucksmann, then a TV producer, was invited to Headington Hill Hall in September 1991 for a stay-over dinner party. She knew who Ghislaine was but did not know her personally when she was invited as a plus-one by a mutual female friend who was visiting Britain. Nicola was struck by the drab, utilitarian outbuildings of Robert Maxwell’s Pergamon Press squatting in the grounds of Headington Hill Hall in a kind of mini-industrial estate. The house felt more like the abandoned set of a <em>Carry On</em> movie. </p>

<p>Ghislaine was “charming, elegant, beautiful. Her mind was obviously very quick but I remember being aware that she didn’t seem to focus long on anyone, there was a sense of hyper-alertness, something a bit on edge. She was constantly assessing the room, as if anxious about missing something in another corner and, although she was very quick to laugh, any real conversation wasn’t welcomed, at least not with me. </p>

<p>“After a perfectly nice meal, Ghislaine announced that she was in charge of games. She came out of the next room with blindfolds for the men, explaining that the women were to take off their tops and their bras and present themselves to the men, who were to identify the women from the size and feel of their breasts.” </p>

<p>Nicola and her friend made their excuses and left: “There was no joy in that game. If this betrayed how Ghislaine viewed her own body, and what she felt she had to do with it to entertain men, then it’s haunting. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman but where was her sense of her own worth?”</p>

<p>Nicola remains unsettled by the evening at Headington Hill Hall because of the shadows cast by Ghislaine’s tragedy: “There was something about her seeming to see sex as simply a currency that stayed with me.”</p>

<p>Epstein chose his pimp well. His empire of influence was built on using sex as a currency. Smart at maths, sussed and sassy, she was an insider trader in male lust and, boy, did it pay off. She made the horrible mistake of falling in love with him. After some years, he dropped her for the crime of being too old but she was paid handsomely, maybe some $30m, to find fresh children to serve his perversion, not greatly troubled by what she was doing because, for her, with her father, it was kind of normal. Together, Epstein and Ghislaine created a thing of evil and now it stinks to low heaven. </p>

<p>The big panorama is grim, grimmer by the hour: every voter in the west who thinks poorly of politicians, that they are only in it for themselves, that power is rotten through and through, now has much ammunition to fire. And that means the very idea of democratic power itself is being poisoned. </p>

<p>We need to clean out the sewer fast before gangrene sets in and the predator dictators in Moscow and Beijing make yet more kills. But there is precious little chance of that. What faith can the public have in a British government clear-up if the man in charge is the fool who hired Mandelson to be our man in Washington DC in the first place? Why does Keir Starmer pick 2026 as the year that he worked out that Mandelson was an ocean-going crook? </p>

<p>Why not 1998 like the rest of us? That’s when he first fell on his sword, after forgetting to declare a £373,000 “home loan” from fellow MP Geoffrey Robinson to buy a house. Or, say, 2001, when he resigned a second time following accusations of using his position to influence a passport application for an Indian oligarch. </p>

<p>Or 2005? That year had been difficult for Jeffrey Epstein, what with the Palm Beach Police Department raid on his house on El Brillo Way and their seizure of what evidence was left, including a phone-call log pointing to a string of schoolgirls arranging massages with his team. </p>

<p>The good news was that, for at least some part of the Christmas break, one of Ghislaine Maxwell’s best friends, Mandelson, was on hand in the Caribbean to cheer him up. Mandelson was captured in a photo trying on a white belt in an upmarket boutique on the island of St Barts, roughly 140 miles due east from Little St Jeffs, with Epstein looking on. </p>

<p>Or, say, 2007? Around this time a photograph pops up of Epstein celebrating his birthday in Paris by blowing out the candles on the cake along with his chum, “Petie”. Or what about 2008, when Mandelson was gallivanting on Oleg Deripaska’s yacht? </p>

<p>I could go on and I will. </p>

<p>What about 2017 when I tried to make a <em>Newsnight</em> film about the $500,000 Mandelson made from being a director of Sistema, a Russian conglomerate, whose boss was arrested for money-laundering? In one script draft, I included a clip of James Harding, the BBC head of news, laughing with Mandelson when he had interviewed him previously at the <em>Times</em>. The film opened like this: </p>

<p><em>Sweeney: “Back in the day Lord Mandelson of Foy was pretty hardcore when challenged about his habit of palling around with the filthy rich.”</em></p>

<p><em>Harding clip: “you hang out with Oleg Deripaska, Nat Rothschild?” </em></p>

<p><em>Mandelson: “Good for me!” </em></p>

<p><em>Harding and Mandelson laugh. </em></p>

<p>The BBC lacked enthusiasm for our story. Pretty much every reporter who had a go at Mandelson will have a version of this story, when their journalism was spiked by the great Svengali, of rumours, hard to pin down, that he might have gone over your head to the bosses. Our film never saw the light of day. </p>

<p>Or what about, say, November 2020? While Starmer says he had no proper insight into the true risk of appointing Mandelson as our ambassador to DC in 2024, here’s an extract from my podcast <em>Hunting Ghislaine</em>. I noted that there were 10 numbers for Mandelson and his minions in Epstein’s black book. Then I give him a ring: </p>

<p><em>Mandelson: “Hello.” </em></p>

<p><em>Sweeney: “Hi, Peter, it’s John Sweeney. I’m doing a podcast about Ghislaine Maxwell and I’ve got her black book, and I see that you’ve got lots of entries…”</em></p>

<p><em>Mandelson [oozing silicone oil]: “John, thank you very much, just talking to somebody on a Zoom. If you care to call back in half an hour, if that’s OK…” </em></p>

<p><em>Sweeney: “Sure, will do.”</em></p>

<p>I called him back, repeatedly. I got the answering machine, over and over again. Mandelson never called me back. The question to Starmer, his former consigliere, Morgan McSweeney (no relation of any kind, whatsoever) the Cabinet Office and MI5 is simple. Four years before Mandelson got the ambassador’s job, he refused to engage with an investigative reporter about his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein – why was that? Eh? </p>

<p>Our system of justice rests on the presumption of innocence. Just because your name pops up in a black book or the files does not mean that you have done anything wrong, let alone criminal. The critical date was 2008, when Epstein was convicted of one specimen count of having sex with a minor. </p>

<p>The newspapers, properly worried about British libel laws, are currently assuring their readers that there is, of course, no suggestion that x or y or z has committed any “wrongdoing.” Well, I am not a fancy lawyer but taking money from a convicted nonce is wrong, full stop. And sending the nonce market-critical inside stuff is wrong, point, new para. </p>

<p>Mandelson has done both, which is why his collar is about to get felt by the Old Bill, sharpish. </p>

<p>Likewise, in the States, how effective will an inquiry into the Epstein Sewer be at clearing the air if the man in charge of the machinery of power in DC is named in 5,300 documents? </p>

<p>Or course, Donald Trump, the great disruptor, is the man who blew up the sewer. In 2021, out of power, he called on president Joe Biden repeatedly to “release the files” not knowing or not caring that because the trial against Ghislaine Maxwell was due to start, there were strong legal grounds for not doing so. But the moment Trump got back in, the calls to release the files grew so strong, many from his own MAGA base, that he got hoist by his own five-year-old petard. </p>

<p>Trump is in trouble and, at the midterms this November, the Republicans are going to be massacred, so much so that I believe there will be more than 67 Democratic Senators. They are very likely to put an acting president on trial. </p>

<p>Trump, the son of a KKK-supporting property developer who was in bed with the Mob and the grandson of a brothel-keeper, will fight dirty to stay in power and out of prison. He would rather unleash a blood-red tide than face the consequences of his crimes. And only the west’s enemies will benefit from this. </p>

<p>Was Epstein working for the Russians from the get-go? That’s what my pal Christopher Steele has been told by his American sources and one has to listen to the former head of MI6’s Russia House. His confidential dossier on Trump is becoming more and more true by the day. </p>

<p>But I spoke to another former MI6 officer who told me something slightly different: “I suspect that Epstein was a brilliant opportunist, who would pick up one gobbet of information here, then flog it three times over, once to someone like Mandelson in London, twice to Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv and thrice to former FSB officer Sergei Belyakov in Moscow. That’s not quite being Moscow’s Man.”</p>

<p>Garry Kasparov has noted that the Russians, like the dog that does not bark in the night, do not go bow-wow in the Epstein Sewer. Kasparov suggests that it is because they are the hunters, not the hunted. I agree with that and note that the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, made exactly that point when challenging Starmer about his folly in hiring Mandelson. His ambassador had previously been tipping off an American financier – but had he been tipping off the Russians too?</p>

<p>The answer to that is: “Да, конечно”. </p>

<p>Making Mandelson our ambassador to DC was a mistake so bad you cannot recover from it. I bumped into Kemi Badenoch at Sky News’s studio in Westminster the other day and she and her gang were almost floating on air with contempt for the prime minister. I haven’t seen Tories so cocky for years. </p>

<p>But Kemi is not the worst. Nigel Farage’s Reform is still topping the polls. His evil shone through at Dulwich when he sang “Gas ’Em All” but the public can put that down to a youthful misdemeanour. Compared to New Labour’s great corruptee, Farage can pass himself off as the anti-machine man he is not. Farage is part of the Fascist International and the thought of him in No 10 fills me with dread. And there are a ton of Labour backbenchers who fear the same thing. </p>

<p>There is a fresh surge of shit coming down the sewer and the folk in No 10 don’t quite get it. James Lyons, the former Starmer spin doctor, explained on <em>Newsnight</em> that the “Humble Address” announced in the Commons means that the communications – WhatsApp messages – between Starmer, his cabinet and Mandelson will be published. Those will doubtless expose the prime minister’s Trump-whispering for the semi-cynical game it has been. I fear that Starmer lacks the political elasticity to get out of the jam he got into. </p>

<p>Starmer is set to be the first big victim of the Epstein Sewer and that is a kind of tragedy. I was great friends with the late Paul Vickers who had been Starmer’s flatmate when they lived above a brothel near the Arse. I know through Paul that Starmer is a thoroughly decent man but also thoroughly unworldly. Once a thief stole into their flat and nicked the telly. Keir was inside the flat, working on a brief for the McLibel Two, and was so hyper-focused he had no idea what happened until far too late. </p>

<p>The same happened with the thief Mandelson. Starmer lacks political nous. When he feared that he might end up making a hash of power, he turned to Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson for counsel and they planted Morgan McSweeney as their spy in No 10. Naturally, when Trump 2.0 was a reality, Mandelson got the gig in DC. </p>

<p>Starmer has now got it – Mandelson is a crook, but it’s far, far too late. That’s why I am certain that Keir Starmer should resign because his attempts to clean up are broken-backed and without it Farage will be measuring the curtains at No 10. </p>

<p>And Ghislaine? Trump knows that he is in trouble and helping her might add to his woes, so she is likely to spend the rest of her life in jail. That she might be joined by some of the men she used to pal around with on Epstein’s island may be a comfort for her. But a bleak one. </p>

<p><em><strong>John Sweeney’s book, Hunting Ghislaine: Epstein, the Prince and the Presidents: a Gripping Expose of Corruption and Child Abuse, is published by Headline. </strong></em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[How the creator of Peanuts created humour from loneliness and sadness ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p><em>November 26, 1922 – February 12, 2000</em></p>

<p>Two children sit on a kerb. They look up as another boy walks past. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>“Well here comes ol’ Charlie Brown. Good ol’ Charlie Brown,” one says to the other. “How I hate him!”</p>

<p>Those reading this new cartoon strip, quietly appearing in seven newspapers across America on October 2, 1950, are meeting the world of <em>Peanuts</em> for the first time. For the first two weeks, there are only four characters: Charlie Brown, his friends Patty and Shermy, and his dog, who by November we learn is called Snoopy. </p>

<p>Charles Schulz fell in love with cartoons while reading Sunday newspapers with his dad. It was Carl, a barber from Saint Paul, Minnesota, who first got his son in print when he wrote a letter to <em>Ripley’s</em> <em>Believe It or Not!</em> comic listing the range of objects their family dog Spike had eaten: “All these things have been swallowed whole and digested.” The letter is accompanied by the 14-year-old’s drawing of Spike. </p>

<p>Charles was an only child, close to both of his parents. He was tall, skinny and shy, and went through high school without ever having a date. He was happy in solitary pursuits – walking, reading and, crucially, drawing. </p>

<p>When his passion for cartoons and cartooning revealed itself towards the end of his school years, it was his mother Dena who told him about Art Instruction School, where students took lessons by post, sending in their drawings and receiving written feedback from tutors who were often professional artists. The course cost $170, expensive for his working-class parents, but here was a passion worth pursuing and funding.</p>

<p>Drafted in 1943, a 20-year-old Schulz headed off for basic training just as his mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Her death devastated him, and despite Charles being promoted to staff sergeant and ultimately leading a machine-gun squad, familiar feelings of being on his own took over. “The army taught me all I needed to know about loneliness,” he said.</p>

<p>At the end of the war, Schulz returned home to live with his dad above the barber’s shop. He got a job teaching at his old art school, and was able to spend his free time focusing on the type of cartoonist he wanted to be.</p>

<p>His feelings of being isolated as a teenager, his experience of war and the loss of his mother helped him pour his sadness and self-doubts into the characters he drew. In 1947, his single-frame comic <em>Li’l Folks</em> started to be published weekly by a local newspaper. Expanded to a four-panel format, <em>Li’l Folks</em> was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, who would place it in newspapers across the US, and later the world. </p>

<p>They changed the name of the cartoon, much to Schulz’s disapproval. “Although I have always resented the title <em>Peanuts</em> which I was forced to use – and I’m still convinced it’s the worst title for any comic strip – it probably doesn’t matter what it is called so long as each effort brings some kind of joy to someone, someplace,” he said.</p>

<p>Buoyed by a trip to New York to conclude the deal with UFS, Schulz returned home and proposed marriage to a female friend. “When she turned me down and married someone else, there was no doubt that Charlie Brown was on his way,” he said. “Losers get started early.” But months after the first syndication of <em>Peanuts</em>, Schulz married divorcee Joyce Halverson and adopted her daughter. The couple went on to have four more children, and, day by day, his other family grew too as new characters were introduced into the world of Charlie Brown. </p>

<p>There was a part of Schulz in all his characters, he said. “Charlie Brown is my wishy-washy and insecure side. Lucy is my smart alec side. Linus is my more curious and thoughtful side. Snoopy is the way I would like to be – fearless, the life of the party.” </p>

<p><em>Peanuts</em> had all of that. The strips are inventively comic, but it is the tones of uncertainty and melancholy that made them stand out from the rest of what was known in America as “the funny papers”. </p>

<p>They still might not have become a phenomenon were it not for Schulz’s fearsome work ethic and control. He drew seven <em>Peanuts</em> comics a week for the half-century until his retirement in 2000, which amounted to 17,897 comic strips, every single one drawn himself. </p>

<p>No other person ever drew any of the characters, coloured them in or contributed a storyline. It was his creation, his gang, his universe.</p>

<p>“I think of every idea. I draw every strip, I letter every word because this is what I do. This is my life,” he said.</p>

<p>Schulz revelled in the bittersweet nature of holidays, and <em>Peanuts</em> included Valentine’s Day storylines from the early days, setting the universal themes of hope, fragility and rejection. Charlie Brown always thought that the next Valentine’s Day would be different… but it never was. </p>

<p><em>Peanuts</em> characters started appearing on greeting cards and toys in the 1960s – nothing was licensed without the approval of Schulz. Anything in which his characters appeared had to remain faithful to his vision. Television films enhanced the brand.</p>

<p>Schulz loved that the world he had created was embraced by the lonely, that his characters helped people through hard times, saying proudly: “People who are sensitive need <em>Peanuts</em>.”</p>

<p>Schulz died on February 12, 2000, the day before the final strip was published, proving his theory that Charlie Brown would outlive him. That final strip has Snoopy at his typewriter, typing out thanks to those who have spent their time with him. </p>

<p>The cartoonist Art Spiegelman described <em>Peanuts</em> as “Schulz breaking himself up into child-size pieces and letting them go at each other for half a century.” Schulz would have agreed. “Happiness does not create humour,” he once said about his approach to his work. “Sadness creates humour. There’s nothing funny about being happy.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How a genuinely old dialect word became part of a made-up East Anglian pub game]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>The word <em>folklore</em> is a relatively recent arrival in the English language, having first occurred in print in 1846. Its earliest citations appear as “folk-lore” or “folk lore”. </p>

<p>According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, folklore means “the traditional legends, beliefs, culture, etc, shared by a group of people, especially a rural or pre-industrial society; the study of these”. This can include stories, myths and proverbs which are passed down orally, as well as other traditions such as material culture, customs, rituals, songs and dances. The term is often modified by a word indicating the relevant group. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The etymological origin of the word <em>lore</em> lies in Old English <em>lar</em> “learning, what is taught, knowledge, science, doctrine; art or act of teaching”, which is related to Modern German <em>Lehre</em> “teaching”.</p>

<p>The newer word <em>fakelore</em>, which is clearly intended as a humorous derivation from <em>folklore</em>, dates from 1946 when it appeared in the <em>Journal of American Folklore</em>. Its basic meaning is pseudo-folklore – phoney, specious folkloristic stories and songs containing stereotypically folkloric elements which are presented as being part of a genuine folk tradition but which are not. </p>

<p>An often cited North American example of fakelore concerns tall stories involving Paul Bunyan, a mythical giant lumberjack (accompanied by a blue ox) who is a well-known although fictitious American and Canadian folk hero.</p>

<p>One of our interests in fakelore in this language column concerns the extent to which such stories and songs can introduce spurious, invented dialect words into more widespread circulation.</p>

<p>A classic example from my own experience can be found in the name of the supposedly traditional East Anglian sport or pub game called “dwile flonking”.  I first read about this activity in the 1960s in the <em>Eastern Evening News</em>, a newspaper published in Norwich, but in spite of having grown up in the region, I had never heard of dwile flonking, nor had anyone else I asked.</p>

<p>I did know the word <em>dwile</em> “floor cloth, dish cloth” very well, as both my grandmothers had one. <em>Dwile</em> is a genuine East Anglian dialect word – the <em>English Dialect Dictionary</em> shows it as being confined to the dialects of Norfolk and Suffolk, apart from a solitary example from neighbouring Cambridgeshire. </p>

<p>The word <em>dwile</em> is not recorded in English until the late 1700s. The <em>OED</em> suggests a derivation from Dutch <em>dweil</em> “mop, floorcloth”, which makes extremely good sense to me: in the early years of the 17th century, approximately 20% of the population of Norwich were Dutch speakers, comprising Protestant refugees who fled Catholic persecution in the Low Countries and found refuge in Norwich in the early 1600s. It seems perfectly possible that the word arrived in East Anglia with these Dutch-speaking immigrants.</p>

<p>This supposedly traditional game of dwile flonking involves one person (the flonker) flinging a wet (often beer-soaked) dwile from the end of a pole at other participants. But although <em>dwile</em> is a genuine dialect word, <em>flonk</em> is a totally spurious pseudo-dialect word – just as “dwile flonking” itself is totally spurious as a traditional pastime. The whole thing is complete nonsense or, if you wish to be more charitable, a rather recently invented excuse for having a bit of harmless fun and getting some publicity for your local pub. </p>

<p><strong><em>Specious</em></strong><br>Specious<em> is a word with an interesting and chastening history. It comes from Latin </em>speciosus<em> “good-looking”, and in 14th-century English it meant “beautiful, fair, desirable”. By the 17th century, however, the predominant meaning had deteriorated to “seemingly desirable, reasonable or probable, but not really so”.  Semanticists call this process </em>pejoration<em>. And by the 20th century its common meaning had come to be “fallacious, baseless; false, sham, spurious”.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>With Keir Starmer’s future in the balance, the only certainty is that in Munich this weekend, Britain must stand up and show leadership. The annual Bavarian jamboree for western security elites comes at a critical moment: US forces are massed against Iran, Nato is creaking from the after-effects of the Greenland crisis, and Europe has been left almost alone to support Ukraine as Vladimir Putin’s rockets massacre civilians.</p>

<p>Amid the turmoil, the world needs Britain to throw its weight behind containing the Russian threat, stabilising the Middle East and shoring up the western alliance. Because it is very clearly in peril.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Mark Carney’s speech at Davos spelled out the problem: the rules-based international system is falling apart and the security architecture – indeed the basic assumptions – of most democratic countries were based on its unquestioned permanence. The Canadian prime minister pleaded with mid-sized democratic countries to stick together and form a distinct bargaining group to counteract US isolationism, Russian aggression and the inexorable rise of Chinese power.</p>

<p>At Munich we will begin to find out whether that can happen. But even those steeped in the language and literature of international relations are struggling to get their heads around the enormity of the problem.</p>

            <h3 class="pp-post-grid__title">Welcome to the even nastier party</h3>

<p>The experience of great power competition is beyond the living memory of most people. Likewise the experience of US isolationism. We are conditioned to believe that there is international law, to be enforced by international courts and shaped by universal principles. We knew, of course, that these laws were broken, the courts ignored and the principles flouted – but they were at least a yardstick.</p>

<p>Now the central assumptions of post-second world war geopolitics have to be abandoned. We are, for the moment, engulfed in a four-way strategic “game” in which Britain’s choices will be critical to the outcome.</p>

<p>China’s aim in this new great game is to become the strongest country on earth by 2049, surpassing the west by creating a range of new hi-tech industrial sectors that barely exist today. But it does not want to become what America was in the mid-20th century – the hegemonic power shaping all others to its will.</p>

<p>It is a plausible objective, and if it fails it will be because of internal social unrest, economic stagnation and regional rivalry, not the designs of others.</p>

<p>Russia’s aim is, by contrast, batshit crazy. Its rulers believe that a country with a GDP the size of Italy’s can wage an ethno-nationalist war of conquest in Ukraine, dominate the Arctic, divide Europe and shatter Nato. But if Putin’s theory of victory is irrational, his theory of defeat is chilling. “What is the point of the world,” he mused in 2018, “without Russia in it?”</p>

<p>Under Donald Trump, the US’s strategic goal is to dominate the Americas, contain China and force Europe into a kind of economic vassal status, whereby we fund America’s debts but are not allowed to run a trade surplus with the US. This is a hugely fragile plan – prone to the risks of foreign states abandoning the dollar as the global reserve currency and to internal democratic collapse.</p>

<p>Europe, insofar as it has a grand strategy at all, wants what Ursula von der Leyen calls “open strategic autonomy”: a deeper market, rapid rearmament, removing the fiscal brakes built into the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. At the same time it must resist Trump’s explicit plan to undermine liberal democracy in Europe and replace it with divisive, authoritarian ethno-nationalisms.</p>

<p>And the UK? Its politicians have been living in a dreamworld since Brexit. First, Boris Johnson declared we were “Global Britain” – determined to wage a one-country fight to end trade protectionism. That was in 2020. Six years later we are stuck in the middle of a transatlantic trade war, desperately trying to hold together the Nato alliance on which we have based our entire national security strategy.</p>

<p>If you survey this four-way competition, the dynamics have stark consequences for the UK. It does not matter whether Trump and Putin have done a secret deal to betray Ukraine and carve up the Arctic: objectively their stated strategies share the aim of dividing and de-liberalising Europe.</p>

<p>In Britain, no matter how strongly we are attached to Ernest Bevin’s original aim with Nato – to keep America invested in the defence of Europe against Russia – we must recognise that it is in danger.</p>

<p>So the British prime minister must go to Munich not just with warm words, or an emollient tone towards both sides of the Atlantic, but with a clear commitment to collective European security and rearmament.</p>

<p>British politicians like to think that, along with France, fellow nuclear-armed member of the P5 permanent members of the UN security council, we are the leading security power in Europe. But Germany, Poland and the Nordic and Baltic states are now outspending us as a percentage of GDP. With that, diplomatic leadership and soft power is passing to Berlin.</p>

<p>The fear stalking the corridors of the Bayerische Hof this weekend is that Trump will suddenly pull either US forces or US commanders from Europe. And though Europe will soon be strong enough in terms of land, sea and air power to defend itself against Russian attack, it lacks the so-called “strategic enablers” to deter Russia on its own.</p>

<p>These range from spy satellites to long-range missiles, early-warning radars and the specific mix of aircraft and missiles needed to take out enemy air defences. That’s why Nato general secretary Mark Rutte told the European Parliament last month that they were deluded to believe Europe can defend itself alone.</p>

<p>But it must, within a very few years, put itself into the position where it can do so. And that’s a delicate task as well as an expensive one: the fine art of the next 10 years will be for Europeans to assert their agency and autonomy without causing a pre-emptive US withdrawal.</p>

<p>Watching the Democrat presidential hopefuls this week, I am confident Trump and JD Vance can be driven from the White House in 2028. Any one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jon Ossoff or Gavin Newsom could create a centre-left populist surge that defeats MAGA, provided democracy itself holds. After that, even if the US wants to remain isolationist and Pacific-focused, the malevolence will be gone.</p>

<p>But I am not confident that peace in Europe can survive until January 20, 2029, when Trump must leave office. That is why Britain must do two things explicitly at Munich: commit to a strong, unified and deepened Europe; and redouble efforts to create and join the multilateral lending institutions that can fund rapid rearmament.</p>

<p>Above all, we must commit to the defence of liberal democracy in Europe: its destruction is the shared aim of Trump and Putin. Its survival and flourishing must become our own.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Smoking and drinking might be bad for the health, but sitting around with people who see the world differently can have profoundly beneficial effects]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Every person who has spent even a few days in France, especially outside of Paris, will have come across a bar-tabac. New York has its bodegas, with their cats and chopped cheese sandwiches, and Britain has its corner shops, which are somehow stocked with anything a person could ever need.</p>

<p>The French bar-tabac offers something else; half shop, half bistro, it’s a world unto itself. You can buy cigarettes and other tobacco products there, of course, but it’s also a reliable favourite for anyone in need of lottery tickets and stamps. Customers’ children will also usually be able to replenish their sweets and gum stash at the counter. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The other half of the business takes place a few steps away from that transaction; in the bar area, locals – usually men, sometimes women, often people of a certain age – will be sitting at little tables, drinking their wine or their coffee, and generally passing the time.</p>

<p>Bar-tabacs aren’t the most glamorous of places; you wouldn’t send a tourist there, or spend an afternoon in one yourself unless you had few other options. Still, like the humble local pub, communities tend to miss them when they’re gone. This is a problem as, according to a recent study, their number has fallen dramatically over the past few decades, going from around 200,000 across France in 1960 to a mere 38,800 in 2023.</p>

<p>You could probably argue that the shift isn’t wholly negative, as it may show that, among other things, people just don’t smoke or drink as much as they used to, and they have access to better coffee at home and elsewhere. Still, bar-tabacs aren’t merely convenient, but an important part of the fabric of French society.</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2022, the distinguished CEPREMAP research centre studied the closures of 18,000 bar-tabacs across the country. They found that, even adjusting for factors from immigration to unemployment rates, areas became more likely to vote for the far right in the years following the closure of the local bar-tabac. Crucially, no other small business was found to have such an effect on the way a neighbourhood voted.</p>

<p>Speaking about his work, academic Hugo Subtil explained that “these closures receive little media attention, but we have noticed that this dearth of local social interaction has a long-term impact on the [electoral] performance of the National Rally”. Though the figures aren’t huge – usually between 1.3% and 3.6% – they are enough to change the results of close races. France has had many of those over the past few years.</p>

<p>What they reveal is also a sad change in the way people increasingly interact with the world. As Subtil said of this new state of affairs: “Individuals see each other less, they socialise differently. They will find themselves… refocusing on their family and friends, people with whom they already share many social characteristics and opinions. With this relational withdrawal, there are… fewer different points of view.” </p>

<p>As a result, “politics becomes a confrontation between atomised individuals and national media narratives”. Stripped of a social middle ground between the individual and the national, people then become less open to new ideas, more entrenched in their own opinions and, clearly, increasingly likely to favour politicians who will enable their more reactionary beliefs.</p>

<p>At risk of stating the obvious, this dynamic isn’t solely concerning in France, and applies to Britain’s pubs, America’s diners, and any other places where people may gather despite having little in common, save for the neighbourhood they happen to live in. Every country will have its own version of beloved but often ignored or mistreated third spaces; all of them will keep getting worse if those places don’t start getting a bit more love sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>That is the one silver lining the study found. If a new bar-tabac opens in an area, the far right will, over time, end up losing an average of 1.25% of the vote share there. In short: those social and political changes aren’t irreversible. </p>

<p>Though much has been made of people becoming lazier and the internet making it too convenient to never leave the house, the CEPREMAP’s work did show that people are still fundamentally influenced by their environment, and will, if given the opportunity, socialise with their fellow man, becoming less amenable to far right ideas in the process. Or, in even fewer words: if you build it, they will come. Santé!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The dissident artist has been targeted by China – but On Censorship reveals a wider world of control]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>You are in prison and two guards watch your every move, one on each side of you. They don’t leave you alone for a second, not when you use the shower or toilet, not when you’re sleeping. Privacy is just whatever interior thoughts you’re able to muster in that predicament. </p>

<p>Then, on your release, you are scrutinised via multiple cameras outside your house, guards control who comes in and out, your communications are monitored and restricted. Later, you find listening devices hidden inside electric sockets in your studio. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>The artist Ai Weiwei has survived all this and more. He knows about authoritarian censorship, surveillance, intimidation and state control. It’s sometimes the subject of his art, when he turns what has been done to him back on the perpetrators, as for instance with “Ai Weiwei cam”, for which he installed four of his own cameras and streamed his own life online, another work that was swiftly censored. </p>

<p>Ai Weiwei has survived every attempt to break him and is stronger as a result. His bravery is extraordinary. So is his inventive capacity to engage in political dissent through his art. </p>

<p>Ai Weiwei challenges official narratives on social justice and abuses of authority. Like Socrates, he is driven by his conscience and a willingness to be the gadfly who irritates the state with awkward questions. </p>

<p>His international prominence has itself presented difficulties for the Chinese trying to control him because everything that happens to Ai Weiwei is visible to the wider world. He has been beaten, imprisoned, threatened, and his online presence systematically erased or distorted in China. </p>

<p>Since his investigation into why more than 5,000 children died in the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, he has been targeted repeatedly. The authorities interpret his demands for transparency of information as a political act.</p>

<p>You might then expect a book about free expression by him to be directed entirely at how authoritarian states stifle dissent, independence, and creativity. But his just-published 90-page tract <em>On Censorship</em> takes a different angle. </p>

<p>He stresses that this phenomenon isn’t restricted to autocracies. He writes of the “covert” and “diffuse” ways in which the expression of unorthodox views is censored even in “the so-called free world”. </p>

<p>Thought control, the essence of censorship, is usually motivated by the desire to maintain power, and can operate, he says, through the media, through releasing distorted information and lies, and through political and social forces as much as through intimidation by state police and the self-censorship that almost inevitably follows that. He cites the example of how even within the supposedly free society of the US, those who protested against Israel’s actions in Palestine were immediately labelled antisemitic, their stories not fully covered in the media, and some were incarcerated or deported. </p>

<p>There is a Chinese proverb, “kill the chicken to scare the monkey” – meaning to punish a single violator as a warning to the wider population. Ai Weiwei is saddened by how this tactic makes artists afraid, and can push them towards conformism and a loss of authenticity that ultimately proves antithetical to the aims of art, and of humanity. </p>

<p>Censorship, he reminds us, is “the natural enemy of human thought and expression” (John Milton recognised this long ago when he wrote ‘he who destroys a good book kills reason itself’). Censorship distorts our intellectual, artistic, and social systems, “reducing them to values that serve only specific agendas or social frameworks.”</p>

<p>These are the strong messages of <em>On Censorship</em>, and they come close to John Stuart Mill’s 1859 liberal defence of extensive free expression <em>On Liberty</em>. Ai Weiwei’s fears about conformity arising from indirect censorship echo Mill’s concerns about “the tyranny of the majority” too, as do his claims about how censorship undermines social progress. </p>

<p>He adds fears about the impact of constant digital surveillance on independent thought, and deep concerns about the erosion of privacy as a result of technological developments. Unlike Mill, however, Ai Weiwei doesn’t discuss appropriate limits to expression, the difference between liberty and anything-goes licence, the point at which expressing an idea becomes an incitement to violence and so should rightly be curbed. </p>

<p>While <em>On Censorship</em> provides a useful prophylactic against western smugness about our allegedly open societies, and a warning to artists about the risks of conformity, it still leaves the hard problem of free expression unaddressed, namely, where should we draw the line?</p>

<p>Re: “Are you Liz Truss in disguise?” (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Could I suggest that the next time you produce a cover like issue 470 (Farage disguised as Truss), you could alert us subscribers with an extra thick cover and an appropriate trigger warning? I nearly lost my lunch.<br><em>Joe McLaughlin </em><br><em>Bonnyrigg, Midlothian </em></p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>I’m afraid I found the front cover of #470 creepy, disconcerting and deeply disturbing. I have had to remove it and keep it locked in a dark place until November where it will reappear on our Guy for Bonfire Night.</p>

<p>Unpleasant, unsettlingly revolting but brilliant work! Well done.<br><em>Martin Griffiths</em></p>

<p>Re: “Welcome to the even nastier party” by Paul Mason (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>As Reform expands thanks to mad, bad, sad defectors from the Conservative Party, there will be inevitable clashes of both personality and the direction that the party should follow. I’m not convinced Farage understands just what he has bitten off by accepting all these miscreants into his fold, nor how he will control the egos of the “bigger beasts”.</p>

<p>But Reform have no policies, just racist and Islamophobic pronouncements, and must surely be subject to increasing scrutiny regarding just how they think they will manage all the levers and controls of government. Governing is far, far more complex than just shouting on the sidelines.</p>

<p>The problems Britain faces, many of which are structural and chronic (dating back several decades) will not be resolved by Reform’s nativist and racist propaganda. </p>

<p>The party is just another symptom of Britain’s malaise, rather than a solution to it.<br><em>Liz Court</em></p>

<p>Re: Alastair Campbell’s diary on Jeff Bezos (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>In a world where time and again you hear “what can I do?” as a response to awful, sometimes hideous news, not buying from Amazon, not using Uber and not staying in an Airbnb is an easy way to wield considerable power.<br><em>Keith Brisley</em></p>

<p>I have cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription, don’t use Facebook, no longer engage with Instagram, sold my Tesla shares when Elon Musk became a fascist, do my internet searches through Ecosia and only use X to publicly support Ukraine. I’m looking for more things to do.<br><em>Nick Battersby</em></p>

<p>Re: “Face it, Trump’s going mad” by Nicky Woolf (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Duty To Warn, an American movement led by noted psychiatrists, psychologists and medical practitioners, has warned about Donald Trump’s malignant narcissism since 2016. </p>

<p>More recently, Drs John Gartner and Harry Segal, two American clinical psychologists, have spoken repeatedly about Trump’s likely fronto-temporal dementia and decline on their podcast, <em>Shrinking Trump</em>. His gait, phonemic paraphasias, increasingly poor impulse control, paranoia and confabulation have all been noted and charted over at least the last 12 months.</p>

<p>It’s astounding to me, as a mental health professional in the UK, that the world only seems to be waking up to and naming all of this now. He’s going to get worse and the consequences will increase unless he’s removed from office.<br><em>Carolyn Hurcom</em></p>

<p>The problem is not that Trump is “going mad”. It is the fact that he is a deeply damaged person, but up until now the frontal lobes of his brain, which control emotions, have moderated this damage. In dementia, the civilising restraint of the frontal lobes diminishes. In the average person this leads to a loss of impulse control that can be terrifying. <br><em>Catherine Lissett</em></p>

<p>Trump suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He might have added dementia to his NPD, but he has always been a damaged and damaging human. How on earth did he become president?<br><em>Michele Leembruggen</em></p>

<p>Re: “A visit to the Tory wet room” by Patience Wheatcroft (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Prosper, the new Tory group launched by Andy Street and Ruth Davidson, represents the broad views of many people in this country and it would be a big mistake to disrespect them.</p>

<p>Liberal Toryism has been either expelled or marginalised within the modern Conservative Party, yet politics is crying out for a leader who can develop a big tent that incorporates liberal conservatives with the strategic aim of defeating the reactionary forces of Reform and the Badenoch brand of Conservatism. <br><em>Brian Ronson</em></p>

<p>What this might signal is a reconfiguration of our established political parties. Prosper might find that their best hope of pushing forward the types of policy positions they want to promote actually lies elsewhere, not inside the Tories.<br><em>Kevin Collins</em></p>

<p>Re: “When might cannot win the fight” (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Lynne O’Donnell’s casual assertion <em>viz</em>  “Qatar, which also funds groups like Hamas and its mouthpiece, Al Jazeera” should not go unchallenged. Far from being the mouthpiece of Hamas, most Middle East observers regard the objective reporting of Al Jazeera of the Gazan tragedy as far superior to that of the BBC.<br><em>Wade Mansell (emeritus professor)</em><br><em>Birchington, Kent</em></p>

<p>Re: Everyday Philosophy on karma (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Nigel Warburton says car-shelf thieves have no ultimate reason to fear payback or karma in an amoral universe. But around 95% of people have a reasonably well-developed capacity for the pain of guilt.</p>

<p>Even if all thieves in London fall into the no-guilt “psychopathic” 5%, they are at greater risk of poor forensic, mental, and physical health outcomes. This might not be judgment or karma, and may offer no comfort at all, but it is not the unconditional vacuum he suggests.<br><em>Andrew Blewett</em><br><em>Exeter</em></p>

<p>Re: “The death of fun” by Paola Totaro (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>Absolutely wonderful –  both Ralph Steadman himself and Paola Totaro’s article.<br><em>Eile Gibson</em></p>

<p>Re: “The expensive boredom of <em>Melania</em>” by James Ball (<em>TNW</em> #470)</p>

<p>I actually think this will do quite well on streaming because nobody is on the fence about her – they’ll either watch it because they love her and are still in hospital after their frontal lobotomy, or they’ll hate-watch it with a bottle of wine and laugh at her.<br><em>Alistair Knight</em></p>

<p>Another documentary that is relevant here is the award-winning <em>Ask E Jean</em>, about Donald Trump’s victim, E Jean Carroll, but no one in the US will show it. It’s not even online as far as I can see.<br><em>RSP Zatzen</em></p>

<p>Re: Dilettante on hating a classic French movie (<em>TNW</em> 470)</p>

<p>Congratulations to Marie Le Conte, one of your best columnists, in discovering the joy of old movies. May I recommend three of my favourites? Howard Hawks directed in succession <em>Bringing Up Baby</em> (1938), <em>Only Angels Have Wings</em> (1939) and <em>His Girl Friday</em> (1940).<br><em>Terry Weldon </em></p>

<p>I agree with Marie. <em>À Bout de Souffle</em> has dated badly in the way some classics do. An amazing revelation at the time perhaps, but now that so many of its innovations have been adopted by the rest of the film world, it doesn’t seem special.<br><em>Alexander Blackburn </em></p>

<p><em>À Bout de Souffle</em> – like <em>Citizen Kane</em> (1941) – is a great film that is more to be admired than enjoyed. The jump-cut was one of its many innovations.</p>

<p>But also look at Jean Seberg and the way she dresses and carries herself. She looks like a modern woman and wouldn’t seem out of place in 2026. <br><em>Will Goble</em></p>

<p>Marie Le Conte writes that she hoped the police in the film <em>À Bout de Souffle</em> would shoot a character “straight in the face”. There is enough violence without your newspaper fantasising about it.<br><em>Stephen Pritchard</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[Going out every night, dancing around the flat listening to Bad Bunny, the cinema – none of it does any good. Perhaps the secret to dealing with seasonal misery is just to lean into it]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>I didn’t want to write this column. I still don’t want to write it. I dragged myself towards the new, blank document in the manner of someone walking towards the gallows. Even after that, it took me a while to actually get typing. If, somehow, one could slowly walk backwards from the concept of work, then that’s what I’d be doing right now – not making any sudden movements, in the hope that work doesn’t realise what I’m doing.</p>

<p>In my defence, this isn’t about <em>The New World</em> in general, or this piece in particular. I just don’t want to do anything at all, is the problem. We’re in early February, still deep inside the revolting armpit of north-western European winter, and I have what’s called a seasonal affective disorder. I like that it’s called SAD for short: “sad” is absolutely how I feel, and I, too, would put it into capital letters if given the choice. This isn’t a mere lowercase affliction.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Every year, roughly from late October to early March, I have to operate as normal, because life goes on, but my energy levels constantly feel depleted, and I have this voice that goes “oh, what’s the point!” constantly yapping at the back of my head. Sometimes it’s a whisper, sometimes a scream. It’s very hard to make it shut up. </p>

<p>I actually tried very hard to make myself feel better the other day, when London got one miraculous day of sun and mild temperatures. I sacked off work entirely and ended up walking and walking and walking, only stopping to eat lunch but still making sure to do so on a terrace. In the end, I was outdoors for nearly five hours that day. I felt so alive! It was a thrilling, gorgeous feeling.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up to the rain hitting against my bedroom window, again, and I could tell immediately that I was back at square one. I didn’t want to leave my bed but I also hated the idea of staying in there; somehow everything felt wrong, there was no way of being that could make me happy.</p>

<p>I am, for the avoidance of doubt, aware of how ridiculous the whole thing is. Southern England doesn’t get especially cold, or especially wet, or especially dark. In the British Isles alone, there are places that would consider London’s winters to be child’s play. Still, I can’t help it. I sometimes wonder if my Moroccan genes are to blame, and I curse this one half of me which was built for kinder climes.</p>

<p>I also spend a lot of time trying to find ways of curing my sickness, instead of succumbing to temptation and merely wallowing in it for a third of the year, every single year. In 2025, I thought that maybe going out nearly every single night in January would help. It sort of did, but mostly it reminded me of the fact that I was too old to be going out every single night for a month.</p>

<p>This year I turned to culture instead, going to the cinema as often as I could and rinsing the capital out of art exhibitions. It… well it didn’t <em>not</em> work but, as with the walk, the effects were never that long-lasting. I could go to the pictures and have a lovely two hours then walk out into the damp wind and find myself cranky again. Sadly, because I can’t spend my entire life in a big dark room watching movies, it didn’t feel like a lasting solution.</p>

<p>Similarly, I recently got obsessed with Bad Bunny’s music, and have spent many happy moments dancing around my flat like a lunatic, forgetting all about my existential despair. While I would love to go through my days cha-cha-cha-ing from one work assignment to the next, that just isn’t possible. </p>

<p>Then again, maybe I’ve been going about it all wrong, and this is the entire point. I usually love warm, sunny summers because my mood remains buoyant the whole way through, no matter what I get up to. It’s a nice way to live but quite a weightless one.</p>

<p>Though I refuse to succumb to despair, perhaps there is some solace to be found in the knowledge that, at least, in the winter, the things that make me happy really stand out. I went to play darts with friends the other night and, in July, that would have been lovely but unremarkable. In February, it felt like being presented with a pint of ice-cold water after walking halfway across the Sahara. </p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time and energy on finding ways to make my winters more consistently jolly, but what if I’d got it wrong this whole time? What if the secret to surviving seasonal depression is to merely focus on the good, but accept that there’s simply no way to get rid of the bad? </p>

<p>I suppose I’ll have to wait for next year to put that proposal to the test. In the meantime: the sun is now setting after 5pm again. Soon, I’ll be reunited with my will to live. Soon!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>In general, it’s never been the case that you can write to a UK university, demand to give a talk there and expect that demand to be met.</p>

<p>But that’s the case in Reform-world, apparently, where the party is threatening to strip £30 million from a Welsh university after one of its MPs and a social media influencer had their request to speak before students there turned down.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Sarah Pochin, MP for Runcorn and Helsby, and Jack Anderton, a 25-year-old various described as leader Nigel Farage’s “TikTok guru” and “Gen Z whisperer”, wrote to Bangor University in North Wales requesting to speak there as part of Anderton’s ‘A New Dawn’ tour.</p>

<p>The request was turned down by the Bangor Debating &amp; Political Society, which is not affiliated to the university and which said that the party and tour was not “in line with our values”.</p>

<p>Now Farage’s party have taken out the Trumpian playbook and announced that, following the society’s decision, they will punish the entire university and wider community should they triumph in May’s Senedd election!</p>

<p>Saying they would pull all Welsh Government funding in the event of victory, Reform’s head of policy Zia Yusuf said: “After all, they wouldn’t want a racist’s money would they?</p>

<p>“Bangor University have banned Reform and called us ‘racist, transphobic and homophobic'”, he added (again – the society is not affiliated to the university). Bangor receives £30m in state funding a year, much of which comes from Reform-voting taxpayers. I am sure they won’t mind losing every penny of that state funding under a Reform government.”</p>

<p>The threat was amplified by Isabelle Oakeshott, the former journalist turned Reform’s Dubai-based cheerleader, who wrote on X: “‘I want to go to Bangor University,’ said nobody ever. Especially if Bangor University is stripped of government funding and student loan facilities by Reform UK. Is that ‘in line with your values, poppets?’”. Woman of the people Oakeshott went to Bristol University, unlike the oiks in Bangor.</p>

<p>Curiously, all of the previous events on Anderton’s ‘A New Dawn’ tour – in Durham, York, Edinburgh and Exeter – have taken place before local Reform societies, except in Cambridge where, intriguingly, it was to the local Conservative Association.</p>

<p>Where will it all end? Will Oxford University be forced to accede to Lee Anderson’s demands to address its philosophy society lest it have all its research funding cancelled? Or will anyone who requests one be granted a slot at next year’s Reform annual conference?</p>

<p>As “Nigel Farage’s People’s Army” and the self-appointed scourge of the global elites, the ongoing blowback from the Epstein files ought to be the perfect campaign material for Reform. Yet Farage, Richard Tice and the rest of the party leadership have barely said a peep about it.</p>

<p>Completely unrelated to this is the number of times the party’s treasurer, the property developer Nick Candy, appears in the millions of pages of documents released by the US Department of Justice. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Appearing in the files is no indication of any wrongdoing, of course – but it is curious how close to the global elite a humble servant of the working man like Candy appears to have been. </p>

<p>Among the items released is a 2004 email exchange involving Sarah Kellen, a key Epstein associate described by the federal judge at Ghislaine Maxwell’s 2022 sentencing as “criminally responsible” for aspects of the trafficking operation. In that exchange, Candy is apparently told that Maxwell was disappointed he had not informed her of a visit to New York, with the property developer appearing to respond within the same thread.</p>

<p>Both Nick and his developer brother Christian Candy appear in Epstein’s address book, commonly referred to as the “black book”, which contains hundreds of names from Epstein’s extensive social circle. Inclusion in the address book does not, in itself, imply wrongdoing, but it does indicate a certain closeness to the “global elites” which Farage himself announced he was “putting on notice” when he arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.</p>

<p>Some of the communications involving the Candys appear to date from after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution. One message from a third-party broker, dated June 2010 and sent directly to Epstein, attaches details of a flat at 21 Chesham Place in London’s Belgravia, part of a Candy &amp; Candy development, with an asking price of £39.25 million. Nick and Christian Candy say the email was sent without their knowledge and that Epstein did not buy the property.</p>

<p>A representative told Rats In A Sack: “Nick Candy has never met, spoken with, corresponded with, or had any form of personal or professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and had no involvement in, or knowledge of, Epstein’s activities.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Gorton and Denton by-election has been hit with claims of letters from a suspect Reform-backing pensioner and Green leaflets with dodgy quotes]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Reform once looked like red-hot favourites to win the Gorton and Denton by-election, but a string of errors – beginning with the selection of divisive Matt Goodwin as the candidate – make a victory seem increasingly unlikely.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage’s party is facing a police investigation after sending out what appeared to be handwritten letters from a “concerned neighbour” that failed to state they had been written and distributed by Reform itself. The story was broken by the excellent local newsletter <em>The Manchester Mill</em>. </p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>In the letter – which is printed in obviously faux-handwritten text – “concerned neighbour” Patricia Clegg describes herself as 74 years old, now retired, who once “worked hard” and “paid [her] taxes”. She used to be a Labour voter and now she’s voting Reform, she writes, urging her ‘neighbours’ to do the same. Every letter is addressed, both on the envelope and at the head of the letter, to the residents of the property, by name, suggesting whoever sent them has access to the electoral register.</p>

<p>“I previously voted Labour because Keir Starmer told us things would change for the better,” ‘Clegg’ writes. “The truth is that Britain no longer feels like the country I grew up in. Simple things like doctor’s appointments or the buses don’t work. The system feels broken, and no-one in charge seems able to fix it.” </p>

<p>Each letter from Patricia comes with a code above the recipient’s name and address – a bizarre move from a pensioner. They also come in envelopes printed by Hardings Print Solutions Limited, a commercial printer in West London.</p>

<p><em>The Manchester Mill</em> did find a Patricia Clegg on Facebook: 74, as the letter claims, and a Reform voter judging by her comments (though there was no indication that she previously supported Labour), and with family in Tameside. The site contacted her but she has yet to respond.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Reform are not alone: the Greens have come under fire for not once but twice using the image and misrepresenting the words of a prominent Manchester academic on their leaflets to indicate they had his support.</p>

<p>Last week Rob Ford, a politics professor at the University of Manchester and author of <em>The British General Election of 2024</em>, complained to the Greens after he was pictured on a leaflet in the constituency and quoted as saying “The route to victory for the Greens looks more straightforward” and “A Green victory over Reform, with Labour third, is perhaps the most dangerous result of all for the current [Labour] leadership”.</p>

<p>“I was not consulted on being quoted on your leaflets and I have not endorsed your campaign (or any campaign in this seat),” he wrote to the party and candidate Hannah Spencer in a Bluesky message. “I think this note, like the bar chart next to it, is misleading and out of context.” The bar chart showed Labour polling a terrible and mathematically nonsensical -27%.</p>

<p>On Monday, however, a second leaflet appeared – and there was Professor Ford’s face again! </p>

<p>“I have today been informed that, despite personal assurances to the contrary, the Green party have once again used my image and misrepresented my words on a second leaflet circulated in Gorton and Denton ahead of the by-election,” he fumed. “I have now lodged an official complaint with the returning officer.”</p>

<p>Not Zack Polanki’s sainted Greens, of all people!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Fans of the former PM are comparing Peter Mandelson to their hero's treatment over Partygate - except that wasn't why he was forced out]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-start">

<p>Keir Starmer’s woes over the Peter Mandelson scandal has certainly sparked one group of people into action – those remaining Boris Johnson supporters keen to contrast the former ambassador’s links with a convicted paedophile with the supposed minor indiscretions that did for their hero’s time in office.</p>

<p>LBC’s Nick Ferrari has led the charge, telling his listeners how Johnson’s crime was “only a glass of Prosecco”, while in the <em>Daily Express</em>, columnist Richard Madeley was full of fury for how Mandelson’s alleged wrongdoing showed how Johnson was a relative saint.</p>

</div>
<div class="pp-content__body pp-subs pp-subs__post-end">

<p>Under the headline “Boris Johnson had birthday cake – Peter Mandelson has Epstein’s friendship”, Madeley asked his readers: “Can we take a moment to acknowledge how outsized the fury over Boris during lockdown now appears?”.</p>

<p>“Well It [sic] certainly puts Partygate into perspective, doesn’t it? A few illicit glasses of sauvignon; a slice or two of forbidden birthday cake… Boris Johnson’s lockdown shenanagins [sic] at No.10 are almost laughably trivial set against Mandelson’s monstrous mendacity. </p>

<p>“It’s easily the worst political scandal of our lifetime. Even Profumo pales in comparison with ‘Petey’ and his oh-so-cosy years of creepy conspiracy with Jeffrey Epstein.”</p>

<p>Warming to his theme, he wrote how “even Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal (the origin of all those “gate” suffixes to subsequent wrongdoing) doesn’t come close to Mandelson’s perfidy and breathtaking immorality.</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘Tricky Dicky’ Nixon was a wrong ’un all right, sanctioning and then lying about a break-in at Democratic HQ in Washington in June 1972… but Watergate was a purely political piece of skulduggery. Mandelson’s betrayal is fundamentally financial and goes way beyond the narrow, dog-eat-dog world of party rivalry.”</p>

<p>Madeley’s defence of Johnson was broadly and unsurprisingly supported by the <em>Express</em> readers’ comments, who agreed their man had been hard done by. “Boris had 1 slice of Birthday cake in No 10 where he lives,” wrote one, curiously in the present tense, while another mused conspiratorially about how “the woman who Boris asked to hold an inquiry was Sue Grey [sic], who at the time was in secret discussions with Starmer and she eventually became his Chief of Staff”.</p>

<p>Alas, what Ferrari, Madeley and the <em>Express</em>’s readers have either forgotten or have chosen to write out of history was… it wasn’t the Partygate scandal which forced Boris Johnson out of office, but his ministers’ patience with being asked to lie about what their leader knew about the behaviour of his deputy chief whip finally snapping.</p>

<p>Ministers were repeatedly sent out onto the media to deny that, at the time of Chris Pincher’s appointment, Johnson had any knowledge of any specific complaints about him being a sex pest. This was despite the fact that Johnson had at the time referred to him as “handsy” and joshed “Pincher by name, pincher by nature”.</p>

<p>This eventually led to 60 resignations of MPs from government positions, 30 by ministers, and Johnson being turfed out of No 10 by his own party. Not “a glass of Prosecco”, whatever his remaining cheerleaders would have you believe.</p>
