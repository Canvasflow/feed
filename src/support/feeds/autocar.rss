      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="test-img"><img  width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lotus Emira 4cyl front quarter powersliding" title="Lotus Emira 4cyl front quarter powersliding" /><figcaption>Lotus Emira 4cyl front quarter powersliding</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Lotus is poised to offer a V8 option for its <a href="/car-review/lotus/emira">Emira sports car</a> as the company looks to expand the appeal of its sole combustion-engined model.</p>
<p>The Geely-owned company is committed to offering a higher-powered version of the Emira, CEO Feng Qingfeng told investors on the company’s recent earnings call. “We are currently investigating the feasibility of the V8,” he said.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="/car-review/lotus">Lotus</a> offers V6 and four-cylinder turbo options for the Emira.</p>
<p>Both offer 400bhp but Feng ruled out boosting the power of the V6 because the <a href="/car-review/toyota">Toyota</a>-sourced unit won’t comply with upcoming <a href="/car-news/consumer/euro-7">Euro 7 emissions</a> regulations.</p>
<p>Lotus had intended to phase out the V6 in favour of the <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg">Mercedes-AMG</a>-supplied four-cylinder unit, but the six-cylinder has been enduringly popular in the US, the world’s largest sports car market, prompting the investigation into fitting a bigger engine.</p>
<p>The Emira is built in Lotus’s plant in Hethel, UK, and last year hit a sales record of 5272 deliveries.</p>
<p><img alt="Lotus Emira production Hethel" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/lotus-emira-production.jpg?itok=Cjnpc4Y_" /></p>
<p>“The US is an incredibly important market for us for the car. It always has been. So we&#039;re looking at the market demand for the product going forward,” Hethel boss and new CEO of Lotus Cars in Europe Matt Windle told Autocar. </p>
<p>Windle didn’t confirm the V8 but did say the company is looking into other power options. “It&#039;s a very, very competent product that we probably haven&#039;t exploited to its full already, so we are looking at all the options,” he said.</p>
<p>Supplier AMG could be tapped for the V8. “There are some opportunities with the current supplier of engines, so we&#039;re looking at it,” Windle said, without naming the <a href="/car-review/mercedes-benz">Mercedes</a> division.</p>
<p>AMG also supplies its 4.0 twin-turbo V8 to <a href="/car-review/aston-martin">Aston Martin</a> for fitment into cars such as the <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/vantage">Vantage sports car</a> and <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/dbx">DBX SUV</a>. However, it remains to be seen how much adaptation the mid-engined Emira’s compact frame would require in order to accommodate a larger engine.</p>
<p>The potential launch of a new V8 Lotus would be the first for the company since it dropped the <a href="/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-lotus-esprit-turbo">Esprit</a> V8 from its line-up in 2004 after a run of eight years.</p>
<p>Feng’s announcement that the company is considering a V8 came in response to a question from a US dealer who suggested the company should offer a stripped-down, high-power V6 that would be quick enough to challenge the <a href="/car-review/porsche/911-gt3">Porsche 911 GT3</a>.</p>
<p>The 510bhp 911 GT3 starts at £158,200 in the UK, considerably more than the £92,500 Emira V6, thus giving Lotus the chance to raise its average selling price and help reverse company losses.</p>
<p>Lotus has halted shipments of the British-built Emira to the US after the new 25% tariff was applied in April, meaning that no cars are currently heading to a market that last year accounted for a fifth of all Lotus sales. Lotus cancelled sales of the <a href="/car-review/lotus/eletre">Eletre SUV</a> and <a href="/car-review/lotus/emeya">Emeya saloon</a> EVs in the US after the country imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese-built goods.</p>
<p>The deal recently agreed between the UK and US to lower tariffs on UK-built goods to 10% has helped Lotus, but Windle has yet to  restart shipments to the US as he waits for the details.</p>
<p>"The headline numbers have gone out there, but actually the specifics behind it still haven&#039;t been clarified,” he said. “There&#039;s product that&#039;s ready to ship, but what we don&#039;t want to do is jump the gun and end up getting clobbered."</p>
<p>Lotus had intended to replace the combustion-engined Emira with an <a href="/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/lotus-delays-electric-crossover-sports-car-focus-hybrids">electric sports car</a> but it is currently assessing the market before giving it the green light. “Is the market ready for an electric sports car? I don&#039;t really know the answer to that yet,” said Windle. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a3467.jpg" width="4406" height="2936" alt=" O2A3467" title=" O2A3467" /><figcaption> O2A3467</figcaption></figure><h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>It was always expected that truly cheap cars would be the most difficult to electrify. Some people even feared that it might be impossible. And indeed, while 60% of E-segment cars sold in Europe at present are electrified, just 9% of A-segment cars are. The new <strong>BYD Dolphin Surf</strong> is billed as the car to end that discrepancy.</p>
<p>Given we’re talking about the world’s leading maker of electrified vehicles, and prices are expected to start at only around £18k, there is a great amount of credibility to that claim.</p>
<p>You might recognise the Dolphin Surf as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/byd">BYD</a> Seagull – an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric car</a> that recorded almost half a million sales in its first year on sale.</p>
<p>The resemblance of its ‘face’ to that of a seagull dive-bombing to steal your chips is no coincidence – and us making that negative association is why the name has been changed over here. As for the new one? The first half draws an obvious link to the larger electric hatchback that BYD sells; the second half is intended to give the car a fun, zesty, youthful image.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a5694.jpg" width="4570" height="3044" alt=" O2A5694" title=" O2A5694" /></p>
<div>
<p>The few previous attempts at an affordable A-segment EV have produced acceptable enough but rather cheap-feeling results in the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/dacia/spring">Dacia Spring</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/leapmotor/t03">Leapmotor T03</a>.</p>
<p>The Surf is intended to feel entirely like a ‘proper’ car while being no more expensive than those rivals. As such, it’s based on the same e-Platform 3.0 that underpins the deeply impressive <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/byd/seal">BYD Seal</a> electric saloon, which incorporates BYD’s cutting-edge Blade Battery technology (it’s said to be safer and more durable than rival batteries and features no rare cobalt), and uses BYD’s ‘eight-in-one’ electric powertrain, which improves efficiency and saves space by combining the motor, reducer, charger, DC converter, power distribution box, battery management controller, vehicle control unit and motor controller.</p>
<p>There are two variations of the lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery on offer in the Surf, with usable capacities of 30kWh and 43.2kWh and maximum rapid-charging rates of 65kW and 85kW. That&#039;s from the fastest on the market, but then they’re also far from the biggest.</p>
<p>The smaller battery is paired with an 87bhp motor in the Active model for a 137-mile range and an 11.1sec 0-62mph time. The larger battery is teamed with the same motor for a 200-mile range and a 12.1sec time in the Boost model; or with a 154bhp motor for a 193-mile range and a 9.1sec model in the rather confusingly named Comfort model, which we’re driving here.</p>
<p>This puts the Surf far ahead of the Spring (140 miles) and T03 (165 miles) and roughly on par with the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/citroen/e-c3">Citroën ë-C3</a> – despite its pricing being in line with the Spring and T03, rather than the ë-C3.</p>
<p>Standard equipment is generous as well: the T03 feels quite basic inside in comparison to the Surf and its large, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple CarPlay</a>-equipped touchscreen, array of attractive, soft-feeling materials and faux-leather sports seats. </p>
<p>You can then add 15in alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, a parking camera, keyless entry and adaptive cruise control to the count.</p>
<p>Step up to the Boost for larger (16in) alloys, electric seat adjustment and automatic wipers; and to the Comfort for a 360deg camera, LED headlights, tinted rear windows, heated front seats and a wireless phone charging pad.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a0389.jpg" width="1600" height="930" alt=" O2A0389" title=" O2A0389" /></p>
<div>
<p>The practicality of this interior also impresses. Two average-sized adults can fit in the rear (albeit strictly two; as in the T03, there is no middle seat), the boot capacity matches that of the ë-C3 almost exactly (308 litres versus 310 litres) and there’s plenty of oddment storage.</p>
<p>The touchscreen infotainment system will be familiar to anyone who has ever sat in another BYD (complete with the capacity to rotate between landscape and portrait orientation), which means it’s well equipped and relatively easy to navigate but perhaps a little too demanding of someone who is meant to be driving. </p>
<p>Commendably, especially for a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/chinese-cars">Chinese car</a>, there is a row of physical buttons on the dashboard to complement those on the steering wheel (which control the adaptive cruise control and media). These silver plastic dials control the gears (tap the left side to engage park, air conditioning and ventilation).</p>
<p>Annoyingly, however, it simply turns the fan on or off. To adjust its intensity, you have to tap the permanent but small shortcut icon bar at the bottom of the touchscreen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a4913.jpg" width="2782" height="1853" alt=" O2A4913" title=" O2A4913" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>You might fairly wonder whether this is a case of BYD chucking in all the goodies in an attempt to compensate for a fundamentally underwhelming product. After all, the driving experiences offered by the company’s UK-market cars have been curiously hit-and-miss: whereas the Seal is supple and engaging, the Seal U suffers from vague steering and overly soft suspension.</p>
<p>Well, the Surf falls somewhere in the middle of those two descriptions.</p>
<p>In urban environments, where it will spend most of its time, it’s excellent. Suspension that’s on the softer side gives it a generally comfortable and composed ride, even if it does struggle to deal with ripples and potholes.</p>
<p>The powertrain is likewise smooth, and the extra power of the Comfort version meant the various old Fiats that make up Roman traffic had absolutely zero chance of stealing ahead of me during my test drive. If anything, it’s a bit too much: floor the accelerator and the Hankook tyres will often scrabble as they’re overloaded with instant torque.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the regenerative braking is weak even when put into its Strong mode (as with the steering, changed via a sub-menu on the touchscreen), meaning that one-pedal driving is an impossibility. Whether that’s a good or bad thing will be a matter of taste. </p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a5407.jpg" width="6524" height="4347" alt=" O2A5407" title=" O2A5407" /></p>
<div>
<p>The steering, meanwhile, has a nice medium weighting to it in Normal mode (there’s also a Sport mode, but the difference is hardly noticeable) and the springy self-centring works well in traffic.</p>
<p>Get onto faster roads and the dynamic appeal of the Surf diminishes notably. The handling offers no interest to the keen driver; the body control feels loose as you tackle the bends of a faster country road; the sports seats&#039; bolsters fail to stop you rocking from side to side; and the character of the steering now serves to hamper your confidence.</p>
<p>At least it doesn’t feel out of place on the motorway, where it will cruise along in comfort and admirable quietness (you do hear some wind noise at times, but only because there’s no engine noise) with plenty of power in reserve for swift overtakes.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a3467.jpg" width="4406" height="2936" alt=" O2A3467" title=" O2A3467" /></p>
<div>
<p>After a day of driving in all scenarios, our car’s digital instrument readout reported overall energy efficiency of 4.8mpkWh – a figure that, amazingly, equates to a range (207 miles) that is actually longer, not shorter, than the official figure. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/_o2a5859.jpg" width="3688" height="2457" alt=" O2A5859" title=" O2A5859" /></p>
<div>
<p>BYD boss Stella Li described the Surf to us as “the car for everyone” and I’d agree that it should appeal to a great many people.</p>
<p>It may be no dynamic wonder, and it may lack the retro chic of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/5">Renault 5</a>, but it is an attractive, generously equipped, practical EV that offers an agreeable range at a keen price – an amount of money that will otherwise only get you something that feels significantly less mature.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A friend recently got in touch because his wife was looking for a new car.</p>
<p>She is currently running a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-4">Volkswagen ID 4</a>, the Ronseal of <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> – by which I mean an EV that works well as an EV but without being showy. </p>
<p>She loves the thing, my friend told me, but it was time for an upgrade and she wanted something a bit different this time round. .</p>
<p>That’s quite a question, because the list of potential candidates for anyone seeking an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-suvs">electric SUV</a> is long and growing. Three years ago, the clear class leader was the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-y">Tesla Model Y</a>, with its then unmatched range, access to an exclusive and extensive charging network and, all things considered, a rather affordable price.</p>
<p>Today, the competition is much closer, including the ID 4 and fellow <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen">VW</a> Group models such as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/enyaq">Skoda Enyaq</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/q4-e-tron">Audi Q4 E-tron</a>. Then there are the likes of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/hyundai/ioniq-5">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/kia/ev6">Kia EV6</a>, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/scenic-e-tech">Renault Scenic</a>, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/e-3008">Peugeot e-3008</a> and more.</p>
<p>But for someone who loved so many things about her ID 4 but was a bit bored of how it looked, one car stood out in my mind: the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/cupra/tavascan">Cupra Tavascan</a>. “I’ve just taken ‘ownership’ of one,” I told my friend. “Have you heard of it?”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/cupra-tavascan-lt-wr-2025-me-36-1600x1067-95609573-8bd5-41f0-80fa-dcb3106634ea.jpg?itok=mCcKJKvA" width="900" /></p>
<p>He hadn’t, which presumably means he hadn’t seen the Tavascan adverts with the upside-down <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-suvs">SUV</a> and lots of fashionable young people. Or he’d seen it and it hadn’t registered. </p>
<p>So he didn’t know that this is <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/cupra">Cupra’s</a> largest model to date, an electric SUV positioned as the sporty alternative to the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-5">Volkswagen ID 5</a> (which my friend had heard of ) – like the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/cupra/born">Cupra Born</a> to the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3">Volkswagen ID 3</a> – with a sprinkling of Spanish flair.</p>
<p>And this is the main reason we’re running one: to find out if the Tavascan is indeed a sporty SUV, and if so, could this be a sensible choice for the keener driver in need of a roomy, electric family car?</p>
<p>We’ve got the perfect spec to answer that question, with our VZ1 model deploying 335bhp to all four wheels. There’s even a big copper button inside that activates Cupra mode, priming the car for 5.5sec 0 - 62mph pace. </p>
<p>Which sounds great, until you realise you’re in a 2.3-tonne EV and your efficiency has dropped to 1.5mpkWh. So it will be interesting to see how often I use it.</p>
<p>At its heart, though, this is a funky family hauler. It is practical (tons of storage, lots of rear leg room, 540-litre boot) and comfortable, all while being clad in an interesting-looking bodyshell.</p>
<p>That last part draws me to the Tavascan and is, I think, one reason why I’ve already seen quite a few on the road, even though it was only launched at the end of last year. It has scoops, vents and curves everywhere.</p>
<p>Some might see that as fussy, but I like fussy. I’m also a big fan of our car’s Tavascan Blue paintwork (a £995 option), copper accents and 21in alloy wheels.</p>
<p>Inside, it’s a similar story. Whereas the ID 4 and ID 5 have rather muted interiors, Cupra has given the Tavascan cabin a funky spine. </p>
<p>I love it and I find myself holding onto it when cruising. What ’s more, it’s finished in a pleasingly tactile, textured coating that, most importantly, doesn’t feel cheap. The rest of the dashboard is made up of shapes and waves in a copper colour that I can only really define as contemporary. Really, they belong in an automotive art exhibition of some kind.</p>
<p>What’s more, a sense of drama descends when the sun goes down thanks to extensive cabin lighting, which is fully customisable. In a word, the cabin feels special and makes you feel special – a rarity in today ’s world of function over form (Tesla, Audi et al). You can almost sense the fun the designers had.</p>
<p>The cabin’s other standout feature is the huge – and I mean huge – touchscreen. It ’s 15in, clear, colourful and reasonably slick to operate. The in-built mapping is also pretty good but, as always, wireless phone mirroring (in my case, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto">Android Auto</a>) is better still.There are a few niggles so far, though. As with other MEB-based models, all of the car’s controls are operated via the touchscreen.</p>
<p>While there are permanent quick settings for temperature, window clearing and heated seats (the last two are optional extras), activating the heated steering wheel, for example, requires another menu to be accessed. Disabling any of the vehicle settings, such as the often inaccurate speed limit assist, necessitates four touches of the screen, which is three too many.</p>
<p>A trio of quick-access favourites can be pinned to the top of the screen, which makes life easier. More can be added via a dropdown, but so far I’ve found this to be quite temperamental. The speed sign monitoring option disappears on every restart, for example.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the steering wheel’s haptic controls are proving to be a bit annoying. I constantly knock them by accident and they’re not the most responsive when purposely called on. And don’t get me started on the window switches, which require the extra step of touching a toggle if you wish to lower the rear glass.</p>
<p>Starting my tenure in winter has also allowed me to see the Tavascan, in terms of efficiency, at its worst. By that, I mean how its 77kWh battery copes with the cold and how many miles we can eke out of it, given that an EV’s efficiency typically takes a hit once the temperature dips below 10deg C.</p>
<p>As expected, it is currently not amazing, but neither is it bad. Having driven mostly motorway miles so far, I am averaging around 2.7mpkWh in the default Comfort driving mode. </p>
<p>That equates to 207 miles of range from a car that is claimed to offer 320 miles, even with the optional heat pump installed. (This should never be an optional extra in an EV.) Let ’s see what the spring weather brings.</p>
<p>For now, I’ve opted for climate control-limiting Range mode (one of five drive settings), which has boosted efficiency to 3.3mpkWh. Heated seats and steering wheel (both options) make up for the lack of warm air.</p>
<p>Something else I’m slowly getting used to is the braking. The gap between 50% and 100% feels like a hair’s width, which makes judging distances difficult. </p>
<p>Such is the problem that a man on Rollerblades stopped me once to tell me about it. That ’s a story for a later date.</p>
<p>I’m excited about my time ahead with the Tavascan, especially the chance to do proper long stints in it. I’ve got lots planned and many miles to cover. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/tavascan-car-park.jpg?itok=g-97bhkc" width="900" /></p>
<p>I’m leaving a multi-storey car park in Twickenham. It’s a classic, mid-20th century type, with a tight descent. </p>
<p>I’ve used it hundreds of times in many different cars without issue. As I descend the second-floor ramp, the Tavascan thinks the approaching first floor is an oncoming vehicle so it slams on the emergency brakes. A scary moment. But they release quickly and I put it down to bad luck.</p>
<p>A few days later, it happens again, turning down another ramp. This time the sensors think I’m about to be shunted from the side but it is, in fact, a low concrete lip that is in no danger of touching the car.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Tavascan’s safety systems are highly sensitive – far more so than its Volkswagen ID 4 and ID 5 cousins, which I’ve driven in this car park without issue. So an extra-cautious approach is needed.</p>
<p>It’s now a few weeks later and I’m taking the turns wider than usual to steer clear of those concrete lips and almost crawling down the ramps to avoid a repeat of the first incident.</p>
<p>I’m mid-turn down the penultimate ramp. SLAM! The emergency brakes go on… but this time they don’t go off. The wheels are still pointing straight (so across the slope) and the car is now slipping down the ramp. The steering wheel is locked and vibrating violently and the brakes are not releasing. I try to pump the brakes. Nothing. I try to turn the wheel. Nothing. I press the accelerator, hoping this will release the brakes. Nothing. Now I’m panicking slightly.</p>
<p>Then, after trying all those again, the brakes finally release. I drive down the next ramp with caution. I now have no confidence in the car’s safety system and drive tentatively.</p>
<p>I’ve since spoken to Cupra, who say they will investigate the issue and send engineers to inspect the car.</p>
<p>Since those incidents, I’ve not experienced much else, thankfully. But they’ve sadly changed my view of the Tavascan, just as it was beginning to become quite a good everyday companion. </p>
<h2>Update 3</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/cupra-tavascan-lt-wr-2025-me-37-1600x1067-bd5f82b8-77cf-47ba-ae21-70867626d113.jpg?itok=HQA7_U03" width="900" /></p>
<p>It’s late on a wet Tuesday evening and I’ve just driven to my local EV charging hub, an old 20kW unit, for some pre-commute juice. I’ve completed the ritual of topping up my account (it baffles me that all chargers aren’t mandated to be plug-and-pay) and I jump out of the Tavascan into the rain.</p>
<p>“The brakes on that really aren’t very good are they?” says a voice, which as I turn I find belongs to a man on rollerskates staring intently at me. Quite the fever dream.</p>
<p>“I’ve just bought one,” he continues before I have a chance to respond, “and I really don’t think I’m ever going to get used to the brakes.”</p>
<p>I have to agree with him. First because of the car park incident where the car ’s sensors and emergency brakes had a public falling out, and second because the system is just a bit naff. In a nutshell, the transition from regenerative braking to disc braking is jarring, the pedal feel going from dull to sharp rather suddenly when you’re stopping.</p>
<p>This is a problem that all of the Volkswagen Group’s MEB-based EVs suffer from, but to me it feels more prominent here than in the VW ID 4 and ID 5, which is odd.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Tavascan has a mitigating ace up its sleeve that its siblings don’t: paddles behind the steering wheel that regulate the regen strength.</p>
<p>They’re really useful when you’re approaching a junction, and their strongest setting will even bring the car to a smooth stop. I really love this feature and use it continually.</p>
<p>This hasn’t stopped me from playing about with the other drive settings, though, in an attempt to find a better no-paddle solution.</p>
<p>While the Eco and Comfort drive modes offer comparable levels of regen, Cupra mode introduces a sort of faux one-pedal driving function, though it’s too extreme for my tastes. What ’s more, the immediate rate at which it deploys this dual-motor Tavascan’s full 281bhp is just ludicrous for a large <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-family-suvs">family SUV</a>.</p>
<h2>Update 4</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/cupra-tavascan-lt-wr-2025-me-57-1600x1067-1515ff80-08e1-4d70-89c7-aa2ba404f1ab.jpg?itok=yyFjjdEH" width="900" />We speak in the office a lot about today’s car design. How everything looks the same and the sad truth that, in the age of EVs, wind tunnels have become dictators. The issue is heightened further by most cars being based on one of half a dozen platforms, making it harder for designers to be truly creative.</p>
<p>The same can be seen with interiors. Take cars based on the Volkswagen Group’s MEB EV platform: the Volkswagen ID cars, for example, a l l have a similar layout inside, and while the Skoda Enyaq and Ford Capri both try valiantly to buck the trend, their roots are obvious to see. That ’s why the Cupra Tavascan is so refreshing: while on the outside it ’s clearly one of that same gang, its interior is like nothing else. It ’s the car’s most appealing attribute.</p>
<p>While others have taken a minimalistic approach with a purely logical layout (ver y German, ver y Volkswagen), Cupra’s Spanish design team clearly wanted to add a bit of flair, almost as if to defy their parents.</p>
<p>That central ‘spine’ is the best part. It looks great (and there’s a similar treatment on the SUV’s bonnet), it creates a cockpit-like, cocooned environment for the driver and it provides a nice disconnect from your phone charging behind.</p>
<p>Next, the silver, bronze and navy blue colours in here make the Tavascan feel much more premium than its price tag suggests. Material quality, especially that covering the seats, the armrest and the doors, add to this premium aesthetic.</p>
<p>Then, at night, the ambient lighting comes in (I’ve got mine set to a deep red), highlighting the curves in the dashboard. It feels a bit like a fancy garden display, and I mean that in the best way possible.</p>
<p>One issue that I’ve mentioned before, however: it must never have been tested in the dark, because the lighting slightly obscures the mirrors. That aside – oh, and the small cupholders and the shallow door bins – I really like this interior.</p>
<p>I’ve given many friends many lifts in this Tavascan, and while the exterior has proven divisive, the interior charms the majority.</p>
<h2>Goodbye</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/cupra-tavascan-lt-wr-2025-me-1-1600x1067-52afe38a-6c5d-471e-91bb-b89537773a6c.jpg?itok=S6yHvAPr" width="900" /></p>
<p>When I was handed the keys to Cupra’s funky-looking new electric SUV at the start of the year, I was excited, especially given how much I had loved the smaller Born electric hatchback. </p>
<p>While that car was essentially a reworked and sportier version of a Volkswagen ID 3, the Tavascan was billed as Cupra’s take on the ID 5. I was intrigued to learn more.</p>
<p>So, in my first report, I asked whether this 2.3-tonne EV, with 335bhp and a 0-62mph time of 5.5sec, really could be considered a sporty proposition or was just another dynamically challenged family hauler in go-faster clothes.</p>
<p>Well, reader, the results are in. And the answer is… at best mixed. Let’s start with the positives. I never grew tired of the car’s design. </p>
<p>While it is based on the same MEB platform as its Volkswagen Group cousins, the Tavascan seems to break (or at least crack) the mould in a world where it’s becoming more difficult to differentiate between EVs (thank you, aerodynamics and platform and powertrain sharing).</p>
<p>And while you can see the similarities to its family members, the sporty, angular front end kept me far more interested throughout our time together than an ID 5 did over a weekend. It genuinely did give the car its own identity. </p>
<p>But it was the interior that really stood out. Compared with the minimalist, utilitarian approach of Volkswagen and Skoda, Cupra opted to inject more air. The floating central ‘spine’ was the centrepiece: while playing a role in dividing the cabin, it also gave the interior a much more premium feel – helped by plentiful ambient lighting. </p>
<p>It was just such a lovely and welcoming place to be, and made my long, dark winter commutes home much more eventful. Contributing to that, this time for the wrong reasons, were the steering wheel’s touch-sensitive buttons.</p>
<p>Like in the Tavascan’s Volkswagen relations, the buttons can easily be activated by accident, each time adding to the frustration. Because I couldn’t feel them, either, I found myself needing to take my eyes off the road more than I would have liked to locate the right one. </p>
<p>Back to the positives. On the practical side, the Tavascan was a good companion. With 540 litres of boot space, decent rear leg room and storage compartments galore, it made weekend trips away with my mates a breeze – even when it was packed full of golf and hockey kit. </p>
<p>So it’s a practical and comfortable family hauler, then. But back to my original question: was it sporty? No, not even a little bit.</p>
<p>While the Tavascan handles well for an SUV closing in on 2.3 tonnes and offers good levels of ride comfort, it isn’t something to chuck around a series of snaking B-roads on a Sunday morning. </p>
<p>The car just isn’t set up to be a point-and-go machine like the Born: the steering isn’t direct, the weight isn’t particularly well balanced and the chassis doesn’t allow any form of playfulness. </p>
<p>Power delivery isn’t a strong suit either. Activating the Cupra drive mode (via a big copper button on the wheel) primes the full 335bhp. Sounds great – until you touch the accelerator pedal, when the speed at which all that power is deployed is complete overkill for a car like this. </p>
<p>What’s more, efficiency accordingly drops to 1.5mpkWh, amounting to a range of around 115 miles. As such, I kept the Tavascan in Normal mode 99% of the time.</p>
<p>Thus set, the car’s efficiency and range were fine, if rather less than promised. It achieved an average of 2.9mpkWh – mostly on motorways – for a real-world range of 223 miles. </p>
<p>Thankfully, the battery could be rapid-charged at up to 135kW, so my frequent service station top-ups – note the relatively high ‘cost per mile’ (right) – weren’t drawn out.</p>
<p>My favourite aspect of the driving experience was actually the regenerative braking. The paddles for adjusting its strength were an excellent touch that I used as much as the pedal itself.</p>
<p>In the strongest setting, the regen will even bring you to a halt, masking the brakes’ snappy nature and inconsistent transition between motor and friction braking. Also noteworthy were a few instances when the advanced driver aids left me feeling a bit shaken.</p>
<p>The sensors misinterpreted ramps and kerbs in a multi-storey car park as hazards and thus activated the emergency braking system. On one occasion, it activated mid-descent with the wheels already half turned, so the car started to slide down the ramp – which was alarming. Cupra said they would look into the issue.</p>
<p>So, if it’s not a genuinely sporty family EV, what exactly is the Tavascan? Really, it’s a sensible family car with some fire in its belly – and, when regarded as such, it’s a pretty good one: it is comfortable, spacious, full of kit and with enough about it to keep it interesting as an everyday companion. It feels like it was designed by people who care about aesthetics, tactility and fun, even if that doesn’t really translate to how it drives.</p>
<p>But for those who are uninspired by conservatively designed modern EVs, it offers something a little more interesting.</p>

<p>Porsche is stepping up testing of its <a href="/car-review/porsche/718-cayman">718 Cayman</a> EV as it readies its first electric <a href="/car-news/best-cars/best-sports-cars">sports cars</a> for next year.</p>
<p>Autocar understands the German car maker will pull the covers off the <a href="/car-review/porsche/718-boxster">718 Boxster</a> EV roadster first, with the Cayman coupé due to be shown, as with previous model generations, six months after that.</p>
<p>It’s expected that the first debut will come in early 2026, given that Boxster mules have been frequently seen testing during the past few months – and we have now finally spotted a Cayman prototype being rigorously put through its paces on track.</p>
<p>These photos from the Nürburgring Nordschleife provide our clearest look yet at the new two-seat EV and show just how close it will be to its existing ICE sibling in size and styling.</p>
<p>A few key changes are evident, though, such as new lights and a more angular bonnet – both influenced by the <a href="/car-review/porsche/taycan">Taycan electric saloon</a> in a probable push for optimal slipperiness.</p>
<p>There are also wider air intakes to provide extra cooling for the brakes and what is likely to be a dual-motor powertrain.</p>
<p>The Cayman and Boxster EVs use a new bespoke electric sports car platform to ensure they offer a “real sports car feeling”, <a href="/car-review/porsche">Porsche</a> R&D chief Michael Steiner has previously told Autocar.</p>
<p>In pursuit of a light and nimble driving experience, the battery pack will be sited behind the driver – similar to a mid-engined ICE car set-up – rather than under the floor. The aim is to optimise balance and to make the driving position as low as possible.</p>
<p>No official figures have been given, but the motors are expected to come from the larger Taycan, whose outputs start at 402bhp and top out at 1019bhp.</p>

<p>The relief that followed the government’s announcement that the UK was first to <a href="/car-news/business-government-and-legislation/trump-slashes-import-tariff-uk-made-vehicles-10">agree a deal with the US</a> to lower the worst of president Donald Trump’s tariff hikes on imported cars has been tempered by concern in the industry that the details are still hazy.</p>
<p>The so-called US-UK economic prosperity deal agreed that the tariffs of 27.5% on UK cars imported to the US would be cut to 10% on a maximum of 100,000 cars per year. </p>
<p>But the wording of the agreement showed that the deal remains in principle only, with details to be thrashed out “following a reasonable period of negotiation”.</p>
<p>UK car makers including <a href="/car-review/lotus">Lotus</a>, <a href="/car-review/bentley">Bentley</a> and JLR are now pressing for concrete answers as they reset their US businesses following the significant upheaval caused by the tariff changes in the past couple of months, including the halting of shipments.</p>
<p>“The headline numbers are out there, but actually the specifics behind it still haven&#039;t been clarified,” new Lotus Europe CEO Matt Windle told Autocar. “There&#039;s product that&#039;s ready to ship… but what we don&#039;t want to do is jump the gun and end up getting clobbered on tariffs.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question is who qualifies for the 100,000-car quota and who pays when it’s reached, which it almost certainly will be. </p>
<p>Last year, the UK shipped around 107,000 cars to the US, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), and car makers were hoping to improve on that to counter the shrinkage that all luxury brands are experiencing in China. </p>
<p>For example, JLR sales grew 27% last year in the US to 120,279. (Not all JLR models come from the UK – for example, the <a href="/car-review/land-rover/defender">Defender</a> and the <a href="/car-review/land-rover/discovery">Discovery</a>.)</p>
<p>“How it works is the big question,” Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser told the audience at the  recent Financial Times Future of the Car conference. “Anyone in the room know? If it’s 100,000 cars for Bentley, I can live with that,” he joked, before adding: “[The deal] was highly appreciated. But it&#039;s still not operational. There is a long list of open questions at the moment for sure.”</p>
<p>In his announcement in May at the JLR Solihull plant, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped to increase that quota.</p>
<p>SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes was similarly relaxed. “Exactly how the 100,000 is allocated is still to be determined,” he told the audience at the SMMT&#039;s annual test day. “[But] ultimately we view this as a floor rather than a ceiling.”</p>
<p>The other potential sticking point are rules of origin. These are requirements attached to every trade deal that a certain percentage of the car’s value originates in that country – eg. the use of locally made parts. That way, the two countries prevent the deal from inadvertently enriching a third country.</p>
<p>The requirements have yet to be determined but would have to take into account that UK cars are built with a high percentage of parts from the European Union.</p>
<p>The EU-UK deal following Brexit came with an onerous rules-of-origin requirement but at least the counterparty on that deal was a big source of parts. However, the EU has yet to agree a deal with the US, which could complicate the details of the US-UK deal.</p>
<p>Car makers and the SMMT have expressed their appreciation that the deal was done so quickly, even though the 10% tariff is still substantially higher than the 2.5% they were paying before. </p>
<p>“We really welcome the deal,” JLR chief financial officer Richard Molyneux said on his company’s recent earnings call. The company was facing a 1000% increase on the tariff bill for its biggest market, which accounted for a third of all its cars sold globally in the financial year to the end of March. </p>
<p>“But remember, there will still be a 300% increase in the cost of tariffs versus where we were in March,” Molyneux warned investors.</p>
<p>Windle was also keen to point out the difference. “Something that&#039;s getting lost is that we are in a worse position than before we started,” he said. Lotus – along with other companies including JLR, Bentley and <a href="/car-review/aston-martin">Aston Martin</a> – halted shipments of cars to the US when the tariff was first announced. JLR has since restarted but others are waiting to hear the details. </p>
<p>Lotus had been trying to grow sales for the Norfolk-built <a href="/car-review/lotus/emira">Emira sports car</a> in the US and was reliant on the car to establish itself in the country again after separate, even more prohibitive tariffs on Chinese-built <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> forced the company to stop selling the <a href="/car-review/lotus/eletre">Eletre</a> and <a href="/car-review/lotus/emeya">Emeya</a> there. Now the Emira is on pause too until the deal has been finalised, which means no new Lotuses are going to the US. “We&#039;re waiting for the specifics,” said Windle.</p>
<p>Another stumbling block might be the negative reaction to the deal from US car makers, who are angry that the UK secured a deal before they could negotiate a lower tariff bill on cars they ship from Mexico and Canada that don’t qualify for the tough rules-of-origin requirements under the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). </p>
<p>“Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA-compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts,” governor Matt Blunt, president of US auto body the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement. “This hurts American auto makers, suppliers, and auto workers.”  Trump could easily backtrack under pressure.</p>
<p>The work now is to calm those fears. “You want to demonstrate that the UK industry and their exports are not in competition with US manufacturing,” said Hawes.</p>
<p>Many car makers realised that tariffs are Trump’s favourite cudgel when it comes to global trade and had prepared in advance by stuffing dealers with stock and allowing them to ride the period before the tariffs could be negotiated back down. Molyneux, for example, warned that strong JLR sales in the quarter ending 30 March won’t be repeated in the following three months for that reason.</p>
<p>JLR still has the problem that its Discovery and best-selling Defender model are built in the EU at its Slovakia plant and Molyneux called on the UK government to help support JLR’s efforts to press its case to the EU to negotiate a quick settlement with the US. </p>
<p>JLR’s problems are much reduced by the promised deal but the company will still work on cost-cutting measures to help mitigate the ongoing threat. Molyneux said: “It&#039;s certainly been a journey over the last couple of months and a journey that probably still has not reached its end.”</p>

<p>Looking for your first car but don’t just want a boring, middle-of-the-road econobox runaround? Then this list is for you.</p>
<p>We’ve put together the best starter cars that are cheap to insure, reliable and abundantly easy to find on the second-hand market, yet still manage to have bags of personality and good looks.</p>
<p>After years of driving, testing, scanning classifieds, and clicking through insurance quotes, we rate the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/up">VW Up</a> as the best first car. It’s developed a cult classic following because of its ubiquity, ease of use and charmingly utilitarian and no-nonsense nature.</p>
<p>Not into the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen">VW</a>? No problem. Every car on this list brings something special to the table - whether it’s size, speed, or style. From <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-city-cars">city cars</a> to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-small-suvs">small SUVs</a>, with an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric car</a> thrown in for good measure, there’s something for everyone after a first car on this list.</p>
</div>
<h2>1. Volkswagen Up</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-vw-up.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: overall</strong></p>
<p>The Up is both cheap both to buy and insure, and there are hundreds available for your picking and choosing.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t interesting. It has charm. Character. Kudos, even. It has one of the longest wheelbases in its class and the wheels are pushed right out to the far corners, which means it handles with verve and is spacious inside. You can easily fit four adults in it and still get a spare wheel under the boot.</p>
<p>It&#039;s not just cleverly packaged either: its 1.0-litre engine sounds fantastic, despite being comedically slow. It was offered in two states of tune: 59bhp and 74bhp.</p>
<p>But that leisurely pace can be a fun factor in its own right, and you get the by-product of cheap running costs. Either engines should achieve more than 50mpg and spare parts are available like iron on Mars.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>2. Seat Ibiza</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-seat-ibiza.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: flair </strong></p>
<p>The genius of the Seat Ibiza is that it blends a youthful fit and feel with complete ubiquity. People can drive something that isn’t too staid, all good in the knowledge that there are thousands of models on the used market to choose from. This makes it cheap to buy and among the cheapest cars to insure in the UK.</p>
<p>The exterior looks pretty sporty, but up front you will find low-powered engines that provide low running costs. Do a lot of motorway miles? We recommend going for the 1.4-litre diesel. It struggles less at speed than the low bhp petrols and will offer better MPG in this real-world application. Officially, it can get up to 80.7mpg.</p>
<p>Inside, it’s pure Volkswagen Group, in that it’s pretty bland but largely well put together. Plus, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto">Android Auto</a> may be available, depending on which model you go for, giving you simple and instant access to apps such as Google Maps.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>3. Ford Fiesta</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-ford-fiesta.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: driving fun</strong></p>
<p>The Ford Fiesta was always going to make this list. It doesn&#039;t matter which spec, which year or which price you get one for: it’s usually good.</p>
<p>We would go for the latest model though, which went off sale in 2024. There are thousands of cars on the used market at any given moment and prices continue to drop.</p>
<p>For a run-of-the-mill supermini the Ford really shines in the driving department. Its balance of grip, body control and agility make it really fun to drive most of the time. And by far and away the sweetest car to pilot on this list.</p>
<p>There are a few engines on offer for this model. We’d recommend the mild hybrid Ecoboost. It’s still economical (you should see 50mpg in real-world) and insurance friendly, but a 30-70mph time of 8.4secs proves it&#039;s no slouch.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>4. Renault Clio</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-renault-clio.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: interior quality</strong></p>
<p>Modern design, a huge boot and economical engines are chief of the reasons to buy Renault’s evergreen <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-superminis">supermini</a>.</p>
<p>It’s plusher than you might imagine a French hatchback to be too, with everything feeling well put together. The infotainment is bang up-to-date and has the usual Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and it even gets niceties such as cruise control.</p>
<p>There are two engines on offer. The three-cylinder 1.0-litre jobby is quiet, smooth and very economical as long as you make the most out of the six-speed manual ‘box. There’s also a 1.6-litre hybrid, which is both more economical (60mpg versus 50mpg) and quicker. Naturally, the hybrid is more money. But both are great options. </p>
</div>
</p><h2>5. Mini Cooper</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-mini-cooper.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: style</strong></p>
<p>Could a first car list ever be complete without a Mini? Generations of Brits have grown up with them and this latest version might just be the best yet.</p>
<p>It’s certainly easy to drive. The steering is accurate and intuitive, really giving you confidence to place the car correctly in tight squeezes. It’s a hoot as well, with the firm suspension making it quite Tiggerish on UK roads - bouncing with boundless energy down the road.</p>
<p>The 1.5-litre three-cylinder Cooper C is the one to go for here. It only comes with an automatic gearbox, which might come as a bit of a shock to some, but it’s the cheapest to insure and run. Over the course of a week we averaged 43.4mpg in one.</p>
<p>Interior-wise it’s the most minimal and modern on this list. Mini has removed all unnecessary trimmings and buttons and it feels spartan - in a good way. The huge circular infotainment screen is great for tech lovers but quick word of warning - Apple CarPlay is displayed as a square inside the circle, meaning you can’t take full advantage of the screen while using it.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>6. Peugeot 208</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-peugeot-208.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: bargain prices</strong></p>
<p>A truly compelling first car choice. It has been the bestselling supermini throughout various countries in Europe, it has a genuinely posh interior and best of all it is great value.</p>
<p>Equipment levels are hard to fault - all models come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto - and the quality of materials are a cut above other cars of this price point. Admittedly there are a few rogue bits of cheap plastic if you really look, though.</p>
<p>Like with the Renault Clio, the 208 offers a petrol and hybrid option. The hybrid comes with an automatic gearbox and is more economical and powerful than the regular petrol, but is also more expensive.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>7. Volkswagen T-Cross</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-vw-t-cross.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: practicality</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone seeking their first car is some worry-free 17-year old. And the T-Cross is perfect if you require that extra bit of space.</p>
<p>It sits on the same platform as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/polo">VW Polo</a>, which means it inherits that car’s frugal engines that are economical and cheap to insure, but teams it with a larger, taller body that’s a bit more practical.</p>
<p>Passenger space, for both front and rear occupants, is impressive and much more generous than you’d find in a supermini. The seating position is higher and more upright too, giving drivers a clearer view of the road ahead. The back-seat bench slides to boost boot space or rear leg room and there’s a boot floor you can lower or take out - perfect for tall items such as plants.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>8. Fiat Grande Panda Electric</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-fiat-panda-electric.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: zero-emission motoring</strong></p>
<p>A slew of EVs could have graced this list. The <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/citroen/ami">Citroen Ami</a> is a wonderful choice if you restrict yourself to cities, as it can only do 30mph. While cars such as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/leapmotor/t03">Leapmotor T03</a> offer great value for money, but perhaps not the design ethos (nor proven reliability) offered by European marques.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Fiat Grande Panda Electric. It strikes a fine balance between retro and modernism with its design aping the OG Panda, while maintaining an air of modernity to it with features such as a retractable charging cable.</p>
<p>Officially the Panda will travel 199 miles on a charge. Broadly these figures are unachievable but we were seeing around 185 miles on a mild January day when we tested it in Turin.</p>
<p>If you can charge from home, an EV is a really canny way to save pennies too. If set up with a charging-specific energy provider you could be looking at prices of less than 5.0p per mile, which is about half the price of a petrol-powered equivalent.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>9. Toyota Aygo X</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-toyota-aygo-x.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: parking</strong></p>
<p>The Aygo X might be the most pragmatic car on this list. It’s a city car, rather than a supermini, which means it’s small, light and can afford to run a tiddly 1.0-litre engine. This means 60mpg and extremely low running costs and insurance groups.</p>
<p>Its reliability record is stellar too. It comes with a 10-year warranty and is made by Toyota, a company that is practically synonymous with dependability. It looks great too. It apes hallmarks of crossover design - slightly increased ride height and large alloy wheels - that make it look grown up. But its tiddly dimensions ensure it’s easy to park.</p>
<p>Downsides? The engine is frugal, but not fast. We clocked 0-62mph in 16.7secs. Which is glacial, even when compared with city cars such as the Hyundai i10.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>10. Vauxhall Corsa</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best-first-cars-vauxhall-corsa.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: ease of use</strong></p>
<p>A simple car, well executed, with a variety of different trim levels and engine choices. Oh, and it’s so easy to drive it’s among the most popular driving school cars too.</p>
<p>Standard equipment includes alloy wheels, LED lights and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. Ergonomically it’s a delight as well. The infotainment is simple and easy to use, and there are physical controls for the heating and cooling too.</p>
<p>You can choose petrol or hybrid engines (or a fully electric model called the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/corsa-electric">Vauxhall Corsa Electric</a>). Like with others on this list, the petrol is cheaper, but slower, while the hybrid is quicker and likely capable of better mpg (depending on how you drive it).</p>

<p>Welcome to Movers and Shakers, an Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry.</p>
<p>This page is updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Name: Carsten Intra</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: CEO</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Carsten Intra" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/carsten-intra.jpg?itok=STw1lIbr" /></p>
<p>The CEO of Volkswagen&#039;s van-making division, Carsten Intra, has left the company after almost five years in the top job and 25 years of working for the wider Volkswagen Group.</p>
<p>In a post made on social media platform LinkedIn, Intra said the decision to step away was "purely personal", having been made with his family.</p>
<p>"I believe this is the right moment to hand over the leadership," said Intra, adding that the brand&#039;s improved financial performance under his leadership, as well as the arrival of new vans such as the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/vw-transporter-transit-twin-unveiled-phev-ev-and-diesel">Transporter</a> and <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/id-buzz">ID Buzz</a>, means it is "now in an excellent position for a successful future".</p>
<p>Intra will remain with the comapany until the end of June, at which point he will hand leadership to Stefan Mecha, who currently oversees Volkswagen&#039;s car brand in China.</p>
<p>"I would like to take this moment to thank the entire VWCV team, especially my board team, and all partners and friends for your trust and cooperation over the past years," said Intra.</p>
<p><strong>Name: Werner Tietz</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Volkswagen Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: Head of group research and development</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Werner Tietz, head of group R&D for the VW Group" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/werner-tietz-vw-group-head-of-rd.jpg?itok=a_vcDAFK" /></p>
<p><a href="/car-review/seat">Seat</a> and <a href="/car-review/cupra">Cupra</a> R&D boss Werner Tietz has been promoted to the same position for the wider Volkswagen Group, replacing Michael Steiner.</p>
<p>Tietz has worked within the Volkswagen Group since 1994, having cut his teeth at <a href="/car-review/audi">Audi</a> before becoming head of body and trim for <a href="/car-review/porsche">Porsche</a> in 2011. He worked on projects such as the <a href="/car-review/porsche/taycan">Taycan</a> concept before moving to Bentley in 2018. He was named executive vice-president of R&D for Seat and Cupra in 2020.</p>
<p><span>Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said: </span>“With his vision, technical expertise and more than three decades of experience within the Volkswagen Group, Werner Tietz has played a key role in shaping the innovative strength of brands such as Audi, Porsche, <a href="/car-review/bentley">Bentley</a> and Seat-Cupra.</p>
<p>“His work stands for forward-looking development, from sustainable materials to electrification strategy. With this extensive expertise, he will continue to drive forward research and development at the Volkswagen Group.”</p>
<p>Steiner has ceded the role of R&D chief for the wider Volkswagen Group to become deputy chairman of Porsche, in what the sports car brand describes as a "generational change" at its executive level.</p>
<p>He also retains his position overseeing Porsche&#039;s R&D, which he has held since 2016.</p>
<p>Blume hailed Steiner’s "significant contribution” to the future of the <span>Volkswagen </span>Group, overseeing the development of new electrical architectures and for transitioning it to the development of software-defined vehicles.</p>
<p>“His work has been important for key decisions in the areas of automotive software, batteries, and autonomous driving,” said Blume. “I would like to personally thank him for his commitment to the Volkswagen Group.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of the supervisory board for Porsche, said: “We are also pleased that Dr Michael Steiner will bring his experience and expertise to the additional role of deputy chairman of the executive board.”</p>
<p><strong>Name: James Taylor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Nissan GB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: Managing director</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/james_taylor.jpg?itok=Av2QJJad" width="900" /></p>
<p>Former <a href="/car-reviews/vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> UK boss James Taylor has been appointed <a href="/car-reviews/nissan">Nissan</a> GB’s new managing director.</p>
<p>Taylor, who left his role at Vauxhall in February, succeeds Diana Torres at Nissan GB, who herself only took on the role last March. He will start his role on 1 May.</p>
<p>Taylor joins Nissan GB ahead of a busy period for the Sunderland-based car maker, with the new <a href="/car-review/nissan/leaf">Leaf</a> and new <a href="/car-review/nissan/micra">Micra</a> due this year and the next <a href="/car-review/nissan/juke">Juke</a> bound to arrive in 2026.</p>
<p>“These are very dynamic times for the automotive industry, so now, more than ever, we need to be agile and responsive to business needs and customer demands,” he said.</p>
<p>“Nissan already makes two of the UK’s top-selling cars, has exciting new products on the way and is a brand with real momentum.</p>
<p>"I look forward to working with the Nissan team, its dealer partners and other stakeholders to navigate current industry challenges and build the business for sustainable future success.”</p>
<p><strong>Name: Josep Maria Recasens</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Ampere</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: CEO</strong></p>
<p><img alt="New Ampere CEO Josep Maria Recasens" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/josep-maria-recasens-ampere.jpg?itok=2-Ew4u_w" /></p>
<p>Josep Maria Recasens has replaced Renault Group chief Luca de Meo as the CEO of its <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric car</a> development arm, Ampere.</p>
<p>Previously Ampere&#039;s chief operating officer, he takes the helm as Ampere gears up for the launch of the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/renault-twingo-interior-revealed-concept-becomes-90-ready">Twingo city car</a>, due next year.</p>
<p>He will also be responsible for launching a new range of C-segment models in 2028, previewed by the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/renault-embleme-revealed-hydrogen-coupé-suv-2030">Emblème concept</a> shown earlier this year.</p>
<p>"I know that with Josep Maria at the helm, Ampere will continue and successfully accelerate its role as a spearhead for the Group and the European industry." said de Meo.</p>
<p>Alongside Recasens, Ampere named Marie Ollier its new vice-president of human resources, Sandra Gomez its head of strategy, and Vittorio d’Arienzo its product chief.</p>
<p><strong>Name: Ed Jones</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Nissan GB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: Sales director</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Ed Jones, sales director for Nissan GB" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/ed_jones_nmgb_sales_director.jpg?itok=_LHISjnL" /></p>
<p>Nissan GB has named Ed Jones its new sales director from 16 June.</p>
<p>Among his key responsibilities will be preparing the company for the launch of the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/first-pictures-reinvented-2025-nissan-leaf-crossover">next-generation Leaf</a> EV, as well as ensuring the continued success of the <a href="/car-review/nissan/qashqai">Qashqai</a> and <a href="/car-review/nissan/juke">Juke</a> crossovers. </p>
<p>Jones returns to Nissan after seven years with Audi, where he was most recently sales operations manager. </p>
<p>“I’m delighted to be returning at such an exciting time,” he said. “Nissan was the only brand with two models in the top five best-sellers in 2024 and, with increased market share and double-digit sales growth, it’s a brand with real momentum in 2025.”</p>
<p>He replaces Michael Auilar, who held the position for the past two years.</p>
<p><strong>Names: Steve Hicks, </strong><strong>Sanka De Silva</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Kia UK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roles: Marketing director, s</strong><strong>ales director</strong></p>
<p>Kia UK has appointed Steve Hicks (left) as its new marketing director and Sanka De Silva as sales director - both effectively swapping roles.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="602" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/steve_hicks_and_sanka_de_silva_kia_uk.jpg?itok=S-uWxA41" width="900" /></p>
<p>Hicks, previously sales director for Kia UK, joined the business in 2017, leading all sales channels across retail and fleet, for new and used cars. De Silva also joined in 2017, progressing to the lead the wider UK marketing team.</p>
<p>Both men maintain equal position on the executive board of directors for Kia UK and continue to report to commercial director Simon Hetherington.</p>
<p>Hicks said: “Kia is at a pivotal moment right now as we enhance our position as a leader in electrification and build on our range of customer-centric electrified vehicles. I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Kia’s product positioning and marketing communications to enhance how UK consumers approach and engage with the brand.”</p>
<p>De Silva said: “I am thrilled to be taking on this new position at such an exciting and evolving time for Kia. With such a strong product line-up in view, an engaged and committed dealer network and sales momentum at a promising rate, we’re in a positive position and I am eager to get started and lead our sales function to new heights.”</p>
<p><strong>Name: Peter Rawlinson</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Lucid Motors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: CEO</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Peter Rawlinson, Lucid CEO" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/lucid-peter-rawlinson.jpg?itok=5yzFpB-r" /></p>
<p><a href="/car-review/lucid">Lucid</a> chief Peter Rawlinson has stepped down after six years in charge of the electric car manufacturer.</p>
<p>He will now take on a new role as strategic technical advisor to chairman Turqi Alnowaiser. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff will take on the role of interim CEO.</p>
<p>Rawlinson first joined Lucid as its chief technical officer in 2013, having previously led the development of the <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-s">Tesla Model S</a> – the saloon widely credited with having popularised electric cars in the mainstream.</p>
<p>Lucid launched its first model, the <a href="/car-review/lucid/air">Air saloon</a>, in 2021. Its headline-grabbing 549-mile range – according to European WLTP testing – soon found the firm favour as a technological leader. It has, however, yet to make a profit.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lucid made a net loss of $2.7 billion (£2.1bn) last year against revenues of $807.8 million (£638m). </p>
<p>The firm has pinned its hopes of success on the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/new-lucid-gravity">new Gravity</a>, a luxury SUV based on the same underpinnings as the Air.</p>
<p>It expects the new model to increase the firm&#039;s production from just over 10,000 cars last year to around 20,000 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The Gravity will be followed by a new <a href="/car-news/new-cars/lucid-launch-£38k-model-y-rival-2026">‘mid-size’ SUV</a>, due next year and pitched as a rival for the <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-y">Tesla Model Y</a>. This will spawn a saloon (to battle the <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a>) and a third model.</p>
<p>"Now that we have successfully launched the Lucid Gravity, I have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside from my roles at Lucid," Rawlinson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Winterhoff added: "Lucid&#039;s technology leadership is now well established and our roadmap well defined.</p>
<p>"I am honoured to step into this role as we enter the next stage in our transformational journey, and I look forward to capitalising on the tremendous opportunity this presents. </p>
<p>"Our team remains focused on further ramping production of the Lucid Gravity, preparing for the launch of our three mid-size platform vehicles, and continuing development of our low-cost Atlas drive unit while we aggressively reduce our costs."</p>
<p><strong>Name: James Taylor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company: Vauxhall</strong></p>
<p><strong>Role: Managing director</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Vauxhall James Taylor" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vauxhall-james-taylor.jpg?itok=v4XPtm9r" /></p>
<p>James Taylor has left the role of <a href="/car-review/vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> managing director, ending his 25-year run working for the British brand.</p>
<p>He first joined Vauxhall on a student placement scheme in 1997 and returned to the firm as a commercial vehicle forecast specialist in 2000. </p>
<p>By 2005, he was a national business manager for Vauxhall&#039;s then-owner, General Motors, and in 2011 he took over the brand&#039;s crucial fleet sales channel.</p>
<p>He was named Vauxhall&#039;s managing director at the end of 2022 and has been faced with one of the trickiest periods in its history since, negotiating a shift upmarket under new owner Stellantis and the introduction of several electric models while facing <a href="/car-news/electric-cars/zero-emission-vehicle-zev-mandate">government mandates</a> forcing their sale.</p>
<p>His departure comes as Stellantis prepares to shut the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/stellantis-proposes-luton-plant-closure-amid-zev-mandate-row">historic Vauxhall plant in Luton</a> and after the brand recorded a 21.43% decline in annual sales compared with 2023 – a significant drop but also slightly less than that felt by arch-rival <a href="/car-review/ford">Ford</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>In the interim, Taylor will be replaced by Stellantis UK boss Eurig Druce. His long-term successor will be announced "in due course", according to a company statement.</p>
<p>“I’d like to sincerely thank James for more than a quarter of a century of loyalty and dedication to Vauxhall,” said Druce. “James leaves Vauxhall ready for the UK’s transition to an electric future, and on behalf of his many colleagues and friends, I wish him personally all the best for the future.”</p>
<p>Taylor said: “I’d like to thank all my colleagues, past and present, for both their amazing contributions to what has been achieved – especially in recent years, transforming Vauxhall through design, technology and marketing into an electric-first brand – and I wish them every success in the future.”</p>

<p>Challenges facing Meunier include the threat of a 25% tariff on its cars exported into the US from Mexico, as well as a profitability slide that was in part caused by liberal discounting in the region.</p>

<p>"With Volkswagen the UK’s number one passenger car brand, Audi at number two and both Skoda and Seat/Cupra achieving record market shares so far this year, as well as Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in number two position in the van market, it feels like the right time to hand over to Damien to continue building on Volkswagen Group’s market leading performance in the UK."</p>

<p>New <a href="/car-reviews/nissan">Nissan</a> UK managing director James Taylor wants the firm to adopt a “mindset of growth” as it prepares for a big product push in volume segments over the next two years.</p>
<p>Taylor, who has been in position for only a matter of days since leaving the MD role at <a href="/car-reviews/vauxhall">Vauxhall</a>, was speaking at a preview event for the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-reveal-nissan-micra-reinvented-renault-5-twin">new Nissan Micra</a> in an interview that focused on Nissan’s place and development in the UK car market rather than the brand’s global issues. </p>
<p>He called on incentives to be offered to stimulate demand for private electric car sales and said there is more Nissan can do to promote its involvement and investment in the UK car industry. A key challenge will be ensuring that new models add incremental growth to the brand, which sold more than 100,000 cars in the UK last year, rather than steal sales from its existing models.</p>
<h3>New product range</h3>
<p>The new Micra will reach the UK early next year and is the first in a new wave of Nissans. There is also an imminent reveal of the new Leaf planned for June, which will go into production at Sunderland later this year. In 2026, this will be joined by an electric version of the Juke inspired by the Hyper Punk concept car. Also planned is a new A-segment electric car.</p>
<p>Nissan has a solid foundation on which to build a new range of electric vehicles because of its brand awareness as an EV maker, but also in pure sales terms, where it continues to perform strongly with the Qashqai and Juke in the UK sales charts. </p>
<p>The Qashqai will get a next-generation e-Power hybrid drivetrain from the summer, which will boost real-world fuel economy, particularly at higher speeds, and reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>“The drive is akin to that of an EV but with diesel fuel economy,” said Taylor, who has tested the latest e-Power drivetrain in a Qashqai. “It’s a real step forward and there is a part of the company car world that needs a car like this.”</p>
<p>Taylor was relaxed about the absence of PHEVs in Nissan’s line-up and instead highlighted the benefits of e-Power: “As an alternative, I think it’s a really powerful opportunity for us and probably over the coming months and years we need to make a little bit more of than we have done in the past.”</p>
<h3>Why Taylor joined Nissan</h3>
<p>Taylor said “that as a big backer of UK plc” he was in part attracted to Nissan by its commitment to the UK, with its design centre in Paddington, R&D base in Cranfield and manufacturing plant in Sunderland.</p>
<p>“That resonates with me as a company I want to work for, as it has a big commitment to the UK,” he said.</p>
<p>Nissan is ultimately a Japanese brand known for its quality, said Taylor, and "we don’t need to play up the Britishness with flag waving”, yet there is more the brand can do to “resonate that we are a big investor in the UK.</p>
<p>“We ought to showcase that. We have design centres in the UK and we could showcase that. We’ve got a complete loop in the UK, and there’s lots we can amplify. It’s not the core story but there are certain things we can use around the edges.”</p>
<p>Taylor is also keen to leverage Nissan’s ‘legacy’ standing as the original electric car maker, where despite never having had a range of more than two electric cars, it is still seen as a prominent player because it was first to market with the Leaf.</p>
<p>“We’ve got all the ingredients to be a big winner out of the transition to electric,” he said. “What I guess we’ve been missing is the full range of products to capitalise on that latent awareness. Yet over the next 18 months or so, the product portfolio fills out.”</p>
<h3>Incentives needed to boost private EV demand </h3>
<p>Taylor said greater flexibility offered to manufacturers by the changes to the ZEV mandate to allow trading between fuel types were “always welcome”, but “the fundamentals of the challenge and the targets remained” in trying to convince more buyers to go electric.</p>
<p>He said car makers had done their bit with product offerings, pricing and improving the range of EVs, yet there are “bits to do” with infrastructure on main routes in the country to allow people to be “confident they can live with [an EV] and charge it conveniently”. </p>
<p>“Some services have 50 chargers, some five. There’s a little bit of major infrastructure still to roll out,” he said. More local chargers were also needed for people who don’t have driveways.</p>
<p>But a bigger issue is that there are simply “not enough private customers today who want to choose an electric car”.</p>
<p>Taylor said: “No manufacturer wants to force anyone to have an electric car. It’s got to be customer driven. But at the moment we have a supply mandated target.”</p>
<p>He added: “Something probably needs to happen from a demand stimulation point of view” as “over the past 18 months, nothing has really changed.</p>
<p>“If I’m a little bit nervous about range, charging, infrastructure, speed of charging, it’s quite easy to fall back into having a hybrid and feeling like I’m making a step towards electric.</p>
<p>“But if there was something to give the private motorist a little extra nudge, you would get a disproportionate benefit from quite a small action. I don’t think it needs to be a huge amount of money, but it just makes everyone think electric first. You will capture a much greater percentage of people then going all the way through the funnel to electric as you captured more at the start.”</p>
<h3>Nissan’s UK market positioning </h3>
<p>Taylor wanted to ensure Nissan “could be competitive in all segments” and must factor that into pricing even “as we have got quality products”.</p>
<p>He said: “If you price up a bit, you’ll sell less, but if you price down, we’ll sell a bit more. The UK market does react in all the channels surprisingly quickly because there is so much information available to everyone today.</p>
<p>“I’m happy with performance last year [Nissan sold over 100,000 cars in 2024, 12.3% growth on 2023 for a 5.1% market share] and we want to keep that momentum going this year. Then the challenge is with new models in new segments: we have to build on top without substituting products. That’s the challenge this year.”</p>
<p>Ensuring products like the Qashqai and Juke continue to sell well despite Nissan expanding its presence in the B- and C-segments with the likes of the new Juke EV, Micra and Leaf is “a challenge to keep plates spinning".</p>
<p>He added: “That’s for the retailers too, as we need to get them also into a mindset of growth, because we’ve got the new cars coming in new segments."</p>
<h3>His vision for the brand</h3>
<p>When asked what his three- to five-year plan for the company is, Taylor said the goal is to keep its solid baseline performance with the likes of Qashqai and Juke, and then use its new electric cars to put it on the right trajectory to keep up with the ZEV mandate, while “focusing on quality throughout that transition”.</p>
<p>He said: “It’s not going to be easy and there are a lot of plates to spin. But I think we would all be really happy with that job.</p>
<p>“But it’s also building: how far can we push the bar above where we are today? We want happy customers but we want happy shareholders. That’s going to be the challenge to me, to work out the ingredients we have got that are strong, and then work in the background to improve.”</p>

<p>The radically different new sixth-generation <a href="/car-review/nissan/micra">Nissan Micra</a> has been created to appeal to younger, European buyers, in a bid to move the supermini away from being known as a “grandma car”.</p>
<p>The newest generation of the popular hatchback – which has amassed more than six million sales since first being launched 42 years ago – has been fully revealed by the Japanese firm as a twin to Alliance partner <a href="/car-review/renault/5">Renault’s electric 5</a>. This means it won’t be sold with a combustion engine for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>The Micra is aimed squarely at buyers in Europe, a market in which <a href="/car-review/nissan">Nissan</a> is looking to grow after suffering heavy losses in recent years, necessitating a major cost-cutting plan.</p>
<p>It arrives as one of four new Nissan EVs due before the end of 2026, the others being the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/new-nissan-leaf-revealed-crossover-over-372-miles-range">new Leaf crossover</a>, an <a href="/car-news/new-cars/first-look-new-electric-nissan-juke-ahead-2026-launch">electric Juke</a> and an <a href="/car-news/electric-cars/official-nissan-gain-renault-twingo-based-city-car-2026">A-segment model</a> that will be twinned with the upcoming <a href="/car-news/new-cars/right-hand-drive-renault-twingo-confirmed-uk">Renault Twingo</a>.</p>
<p>The new Micra sits on the Ampr Small platform, drawing power from either a 40kWh or a 52kWh battery, which are good for 192 and 253 miles of range. In top-spec form, the battery can accept a charging rate of 100kW to go from 15-80% in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>As with the 5, alongside which the Micra will be produced by <a href="/car-review/renault">Renault</a> in Douai, France, power is sent to a single, front-mounted motor that can be tuned for 121bhp (with the 40kWh battery) or 148bhp (with the 52kWh battery).</p>
<p>Beyond the electric powertrain, the biggest change for the Micra is its radical new design. While it was developed alongside the 5 from the start, Nissan designers were given the freedom to create something that “was more noticeably Nissan” – although “we had to fight for it”, exterior design manager Yongwook Cho told Autocar.</p>
<p><img alt="2026 Nissan Micra in red, front quarter" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2026-nissan-micra-side-red.jpg?itok=AFqPenmW" /></p>
<p>Described as “audacious, assertive and funky”, the new look takes inspiration from the bulbous <a href="/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-nissan-micra-160sr">Mk3 Micra</a> of 2002, especially for its circular daytime-running lights at both ends.</p>
<p>Cho added that “it was tough” when his designers were tasked with creating something that would differ visually from the “already good-looking” 5, especially given the fixed underpinnings.</p>
<p>One change from the 5 is at the front, where the bonnet is higher, longer and features slightly more bulky arches in order to give the Micra a different silhouette.</p>
<p><span>“</span>We wanted to carry more volume to the front,” said Cho, who added that this gives the Micra more of a crossover feel – like the <a href="/car-review/renault/megane-e-tech-electric">Renault Megane</a> – than the 5, which is more overtly a hatchback and “sporty”.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is at the rear, where a lip was added, and at the side (visually where the twins are most obviously related), where there’s a shoulder line that looks “like it’s been scooped by a gelato scoop”.</p>
<p>These design elements combine to make the Micra “a grandma car no more”, claimed Cho.</p>
<p>The interior is essentially identical to the 5’s, with the same twin 10.25in screens, same switchgear and same materials, but its colour offerings – white, grey and black – are more muted.</p>
<p><img alt="2026 Nissan Micra interior" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2026-nissan-micra-interior-dashboard.jpg?itok=gF5JzK1q" /></p>
<p>That is intended to position Nissan’s entry-level EV as more of a premium offering than the 5, European marketing boss Arnaud Charpentier told Autocar. Pricing, he suggested, would therefore start above Renault’s £22,995 entry point.</p>
<p>Explaining why Nissan had given the Micra such a radical styling overhaul, Charpentier said: “The UK is our best market in Europe by far [with 133,000 sales since the start of 2024], so we had to come back with something different.</p>
<p>“I think this new car will create a gap between what people have in mind when they look or think of the [Micra] nameplate and what is now the reality.</p>
<p>“Young buyers? That was the objective.”</p>
<p>Charpentier said traditional Micra buyers in the UK differ from those in other markets. For example, in France and Spain they are younger and “almost 95% female”. As such, he explained, “we wanted to come back with something which is gender-neutral”.</p>
<p><img alt="2026 Nissan Micra rear quarter" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2026-nissan-micra-rear-quarter.jpg?itok=N8iq4Fcg" /></p>
<p>Charpentier continued: “The challenge is really to rejuvenate, because we know that in the UK we have this [grandma] association, and we believe through the audacious and playful design that we see, it’s going to help conquer new types of buyers, like younger, modern parents.”</p>
<p>Asked whether sales could be affected by the Micra’s switch to electric-only power, he said: “We will have to explain that it’s an EV, a full EV. It had to be explained by Renault with the 5. So that’s the fact.”</p>
<p>Touching on the 5’s popularity (16,948 sales in Europe so far this year) and lower starting price, Charpentier disagreed that total electrification would inhibit uptake of the Micra.</p>
<p>“We have a very strong nameplate,” he said. “I’m sure that the nameplate of Micra is stronger in the UK, for example, than the 5. Probably also in Italy. So I’m not worried about this.”</p>
<p>What’s more, Charpentier believes that the arrivals of the reinvented Leaf and the next-generation Juke will help rejuvenate Nissan during a turbulent period for the company.</p>
<p>“This new EV line-up will help us to come back in the race,” he predicted.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/lexus_es_500e_ev.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="Lexus ES 500e EV" title="Lexus ES 500e EV" /><figcaption>Lexus ES 500e EV</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>The <a href="/car-review/lexus/ES">Lexus ES</a> is returning in eighth-generation form as a rival to the <a href="/car-review/audi/a6">Audi A6</a> and <a href="/car-review/bmw/5-series">BMW 5 Series</a> – but, unlike its German competition, it could do away with petrol power entirely in the UK.</p>
<p>In Western Europe, the ES will be offered with a 199bhp hybrid powertrain as well as two battery-electric options.</p>
<p>However, Autocar understands that the brand&#039;s British arm is currently evaluating whether to offer exclusively the electric powertrains, given the greater proportion of EV sales in the UK compared with those in Europe.</p>
<p>A final decision has yet to be made, but it is highly likely the hybrid will not come to the UK.</p>
<p>That decision, if taken, would leave the front-driven ES 350e and four-wheel-drive ES 500e as the only versions bound for UK showrooms. The former packs a single 221bhp motor and a 77kWh lithium ion battery, yielding a range of around 329 miles between charges and a 0-62mph sprint time of 8.2sec. The 500e, meanwhile, has 338bhp and a 0-62mph time of 5.7sec, but its range – which has yet to be revealed – will be reduced compared with that of the 350e.</p>
<p>The new version of Lexus&#039;s executive saloon was first revealed at the Shanghai motor show in China, where it is the number one imported vehicle.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/lexus_es_ev_350e_front_34.jpg?itok=oJWXUAiO" width="900" /></p>
<p><a href="/car-reviews/lexus">Lexus</a> said this new generation of ES makes advances in "ride quality, comfort and quietness" over its predecessor and has been designed to offer "first-class comfort for everyone on board".</p>
<p>The minimalist cockpit marks a complete departure from that of the previous car and has been designed with a heavy influence from the Chinese market: physical controls are few and far between, and a large 12.3in touchscreen takes centre stage as the primary control interface. Hidden beneath the screen is a row of haptic switches which illuminate when the car is powered on.</p>
<p>The new ES is based on the same GA-K platform as the NX SUV. Lexus says the structure&#039;s rigidity has been increased throughout the chassis to boost refinement and responsiveness and resulting in an "agile, responsive feel that belies its size" - which is also increased over the previous car, by 165mm in length, to take the ES to 5.14m overall.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/rav-4-static-01.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="rav 4 static 01" title="rav 4 static 01" /><figcaption>rav 4 static 01</figcaption></figure><div>
<p><a href="/car-reviews/toyota">Toyota</a> has lifted the covers off the sixth-generation <a href="/car-review/toyota/rav4">RAV4</a>, with the family SUV bringing a striking new look and a generational upgrade in on-board tech.</p>
<p>The car’s dramatic styling is said to reference the off-road credentials of earlier RAV4s, with a boxier – almost Land Cruiser-like – silhouette and chunkier wheel arches. The new hammerhead lights front and rear bring its looks into line with those of the latest <a href="/car-review/toyota/prius">Prius</a> and <a href="/car-review/toyota/c-hr">C-HR</a>.</p>
<p>Inside, the RAV4 gets a new 12.9in infotainment touchscreen that is the first to run on Toyota’s new Arene operating system. Like Google’s Android or Apple’s iOS, it is a standard platform that will be rolled out across all future Toyotas, to enable quicker and easier development of new features.</p>
<p>This, Toyota said, will allow it to develop new and more powerful safety and entertainment systems and introduce new functions through over-the-air updates rather than requiring prospective buyers to wait for a new model generation.</p>
<p>At the RAV4’s launch, for example, the Arene platform will arrive with new safety features, such as a rear-approach monitor devised to help drivers merge onto motorways. In the longer term, the brand has previously mooted functionality such as downloadable performance packs that replicate the dynamics of different Toyotas: drivers could, for example, choose a <a href="/car-review/toyota/gr86">GR86</a>-inspired chassis set-up for a spirited drive, before switching to more Lexus-like damping for the journey home.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2026_all-new_rav4_static_001.jpg?itok=eEfaWJgk" width="900" /></p>
<p>The new RAV4 will be offered exclusively with plug-in hybrid powertrains in the UK. Exact specifications have yet to be confirmed, but in Europe there will be a choice of 264bhp front-wheel-drive and 300bhp four-wheel-drive powertrains.</p>
<p>The most powerful PHEV is capable of sprinting from 0-62mph in 5.8sec, and it can drive under electric power alone for up to 62 miles. Its 22.7kWh battery can be topped up at up to 50kW on a DC connection, taking 30 minutes to go from 10-80%, or at 11kW on AC.</p>
<p>In Europe there will also be a choice of 181bhp and 188bhp regular hybrids, with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2026_all-new_rav4_interior_003.jpg?itok=PvCYq546" width="900" /></p>
<p>Also on offer will be a GR Sport variant with a focus on handling and featuring lightweight 20in alloy wheels, a 20mm-wider track, different dampers and stiffer springs. Inside, the GR Sport will get bucket-like sports seats, aluminium pedals and an abundance of GR badging.</p>
<p>Pricing has yet to be confirmed but is expected to represent a small step up from the current RAV4 PHEV’s starting price of £44,120. Deliveries are set to begin next spring, but an exact date has yet to be fixed.</p>

<p>The UK&#039;s largest private car park operators are joining forces to create a universal payment platform that means motorists no longer need a separate smartphone app for each provider.</p>
<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has announced that the new &#039;one-app-fits-all&#039; interface is being developed and operated by the British Parking Association at no cost to the taxpayer, following a series of government-backed trials.</p>
<p>It will be called the National Parking Platform, and will allow drivers to pay to leave their car at all participating car parks, including those run by RingGo, JustPark and PayByPhone – which currently each operate their own apps.</p>
<p>The move will encourage "a more flexible parking experience", said the DfT, following widespread criticism of the reliability and ease of use of certain parking apps – a particularly pertinent issue as councils are phasing out traditional coin and card  payment machines in the interests of reducing operating costs.</p>
<p>Autocar recently reported that the increasing use of apps in place of machines was frustrating motorists, who said connectivity problems and added complexity were causing delays to journeys and even forcing them to choose other parking locations.</p>
<p>One driver in Guildford – which has recently disabled two-thirds of its payment machines in favour of the RingGo smartphone app – said: “My phone can’t establish a connection [to the RingGo app]. I’m already late for an appointment and don’t have time to waste trying to buy a ticket. I expect I shall be fined.”</p>
<p>An elderly couple in the same town concurred: <span>“</span>We don’t like downloading and using apps and would much rather use coins or contactless payment. At least we have a smartphone. Many of our friends don’t. We will have to find another parking space.”</p>
<p>The new universal parking app is being designed to alleviate those concerns, said the DfT.</p>
<p>"Currently, drivers face inconsistent parking rules, clunky user experiences, and unnecessary barriers to something that should be simple," it said. </p>
<p>"The National Parking Platform fixes this, connecting participating car parks to a shared platform, through which drivers can pay using any approved app – cutting confusion, reducing the chance of fines, and opening up the parking market to fairer competition."</p>
<p>The platform will be run by private parking companies, in partnership with councils, on a not-for-profit basis. The DfT promised that it will "operate under clear terms to ensure transparency, sustainability, and public value" – and said the government will monitor the platform to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>It has already been rolled out to 10 local authorities and handles more than 500,000 transactions per month, said the DfT. It has not yet confirmed a timeframe for a wider rollout.</p>
<p>Lilian Greenwood, minister for the future of roads, welcomed the development: "This government is on the side of drivers, and dedicated to giving everyone simpler, more flexible parking. I’m delighted that this fantastic project is being taken on by the parking sector with no extra cost to taxpayers. </p>
<p>“This is public infrastructure done right: built by government, shaped with councils, and now delivered by the sector that knows it best, at a time when we’re investing a record £1.6bn through our Plan for Change, to mend our pothole-ridden roads which damage cars, and £4.8bn to deliver new road infrastructure that will better connect people.”</p>

<p><a href="/car-reviews/vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> has previewed the upcoming Mokka GSe with a rally inspired concept.</p>
<p>The Mokka GSe Rally prototype is based on the current crossover and features Bilstein rally suspension, a racing gearbox, and a lightweight chassis.</p>
<p>According to Vauxhall, the concept is also the world&#039;s first rally car currently being developed according to the FIA&#039;s new eRally5 regulations, meaning it could potentially be used in global rally series from next year.</p>
<p>Underneath, it draws power from the same 54kWh battery as the standard <a href="/car-review/vauxhall/mokka">Mokka</a>, and adopts the same 278bhp, 254lb ft single-motor setup from its <a href="/car-review/abarth/600e">Abarth 600e</a> Stellantis sibling. </p>
<p>While no further technical specs have been given, in the 600e, the same powertrain yield 0-62mph times of 5.9sec. It also, like the 600e, gets limited-slop differential.</p>
<p>Visually, underneath the GSe Rally’s striking design, it showcases a car that is clearly differentiated in styling terms to the standard Mokka with a front and rear diffs, flared wheel arches and larger alloys.</p>
<p>These production-ready features - largely unusual for a concept – point to what we can expect from the upcoming Mokka GSe, a car which <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hot-new-vauxhall-mokka-gse-primed-sub-brand-goes-ev-only">was recently teased by Vauxhall/Opel CEO Florian Huettl </a>and which is expected to be revealed in the coming months. </p>
<p>The video also announced the sub brand would ditch models with combustion engines such as the previous Astra GSe</p>
<p>In addition to the Mokka GSe, Huettl hinted that there will be further news on more electric Vauxhalls. He said: “[GSe] is also a promise that [Vauxhall’s] electric future will not be driven by compromise. There is more to come in 2025 – we are just getting started.”</p>

<div>
<p>The forces of electrification and SUV fever have colluded to erode the traditional hatch class to the extent that there are now just two such cars standing: the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/petrol-mini-john-cooper-works-brings-228bhp-%C2%A331k">Mini JCW</a> and the <strong>Volkswagen Polo GTI</strong>.</p>
<p>These two stubborn holdouts are quite different from one another, though: whereas the Mini is ostensibly an all-new model, the Polo GTI is hardly any different from how it was seven years ago.</p>
<p>At launch in 2018, the hot version of the sixth-generation Polo had a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo petrol engine sending 197bhp and 236lb ft of torque to the front axle through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>Today it has the exact same powertrain, except it makes an additional seven horses for a 0-62mph time of 6.5sec, the minor uplift having occurred when the car was facelifted (in kind with all Polo variants) back in 2021.</p>
<p>That update also brought revised looks (to bring the Polo into line with the newer Golf) and improved interior technology. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the context of a <a href="http://Volkswage">Volkswagen</a> showroom in 2025, the Polo GTI is something of a throwback.</p>
<p>As we all know, some throwbacks are bad and some throwbacks are good. Into which category does this hot hatch fall, then? Read on to find out.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33100-vwpologtideansmith48.jpg" width="7952" height="5304" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI wheels" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI wheels" /></p>
<div>
<p>The Polo GTI literally has a bit of what makes its bigger brother, the <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti">Golf GTI</a>, so special. Namely, Volkswagen&#039;s EA888 engine.</p>
<p>Rather than a proper mechanical limited-slip differential, though, you will find Volkswagen&#039;s XDS electronic differential lock – which isn&#039;t a locking differential at all. It&#039;s actually torque vectoring by braking across the front axle delivered by an extension of the car’s stability control software.</p>
<p>The GTI suspension overhaul comprises shortened and stiffened coil springs, retuned dampers and retuned anti-roll bars, so the car rides some 15mm lower than a standard <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/polo">Volkswagen Polo</a>.</p>
<p>There are wheel hubs and steering knuckles unique to the GTI here also, allowing the car its own axle kinematics and roll centres relative to those of the standard Polo.</p>
<p>Adaptive dampers (which can be switched between preset Normal and Sport settings) are standard on UK cars.</p>
<p>Also standard are 17in alloy wheels, surrounding enlarged brake discs front and rear (they can be upgraded to an 18in set at extra cost).</p>
<p>Volkswagen quotes a kerb weight of 1303kg, which seemed a touch portly back in 2018 but now, in this era of 2.5-tonne sports EVs, seems positively skinny.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33097-vwpologtideansmith12.jpg" width="5952" height="3968" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI interior" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI interior" /></p>
<div>
<p>Despite the Polo GTI&#039;s impressive on-paper performance credentials, it’s not really the sort of car to shout about its sporting abilities on a visual front.</p>
<p>As with the exterior, the approach taken to its cabin errs on the side of conservatism. In fact, it’s largely similar to that of a regular, yet generously equipped, standard <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/polo">Polo</a>.</p>
<p>The Jacara cloth upholstery, sports seats and GTI badging are about the only elements that set the GTI aside.</p>
<p>The most notable thing about this interior is probably the touchscreen – but not in the way we&#039;re now used to. Instead, it&#039;s remarkable for essentially being the same 8.0in unit used back in 2018, complete with physical buttons and dials on its borders. Although it is now equipped with newer software, it looks as it ever did. You can upgrade it to 9.2in for £925 (with some other features thrown in).</p>
<p>The big change that Volkswagen made at the 2021 facelift was instead to the digital dial display, expanding it to 10.25in.</p>
<p>A corollary of this is the presence of a separate, physical control panel for the climate system. </p>
<p>How you feel about this state of affairs will depend on what kind of buyer you are: to the tech-hungry &#039;digital native&#039;, it will look tragically old-fashioned; to the &#039;common sense&#039; traditionalist, it will be more than welcome at a time when new Volkswagen interiors are little more than a giant touchscreen atop a plinth.</p>
<p>In terms of usability, those sports seats are passably supportive and comfortable yet sit you perhaps a little higher than you might ideally like. Otherwise, the driving position is largely spot on.</p>
<p>As for space in the rear, there is room for two adults – although head and leg room are likely to be a bit tight for taller individuals to sit comfortably over an extended period of time. Boot space is identical to that of the regular car, which means it’s among the best in the class.</p>
<p>There’s a decent 355 litres available with the seats up, while folding them down opens up 1125 litres. Although there is a relatively wide sill to navigate, the boot floor adjusts for height to make loading and unloading easier. Bag hooks also mean your shopping won’t slide about if you elect to take the mountain road home.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33116-vwpologtideansmith15.jpg" width="3274" height="2182" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI driving" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI driving" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>Straight-line performance is <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-hot-hatches">a poor measure of a hot hatchback’s appeal</a>, but it does serve to illustrate just how far the Polo GTI has come. Its 0-62mph time of 6.5sec is a mere 0.6sec adrift of the 261bhp Golf GTI&#039;s.</p>
<p>Nobody could accuse the hottest Polo of lacking performance, then, and yet there’s a sense it could be even quicker – and without modifications to the engine. The gearing is curiously long, and while 236lb ft from a mere 1500rpm helps disguise the effects of that out on the road, more closely stacked cogs would make proceedings that much more excitable.</p>
<p>This being an everyday kind of performance car, fuel economy will matter to owners. In this regard, the Polo GTI’s official economy of 39.8mpg is entirely respectable.</p>
<p>If this 2.0-litre unit has a weakness, it is its lack of a distinctive character. We can&#039;t fault the supreme smoothness of the EA888 or its propulsive force – at least until the needle sits beyond 6000rpm, when the balance between power and noise becomes disappointingly skewed towards the latter. It’s unremarkable in tone, however, and the uniformly flat, muted and slightly nasal report from its twin-tip exhaust does nothing to encourage you, the driver, to hold onto gears.</p>
<p>In any event, the gearbox will automatically upshift some 250rpm short of a redline set at 6500rpm, even with the gearstick flicked sideways and in manual mode. The kickdown at the bottom of the accelerator pedal’s travel also remains operational, so you never have quite the control you would like over a hot supermini.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33123-vwpologtideansmith39.jpg" width="3904" height="2600" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI cornering" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI cornering" /></p>
<div>
<p><a href="/car-reviews/volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> could have given us a car firmer, pointier and more adjustable in its handling than the (now defunct) <a href="/car-review/ford/fiesta-st/first-drives/ford-fiesta-st-2018-uk-review">Ford Fiesta ST</a>, but Wolfsburg understands its client base very well, and so the Polo GTI’s dynamic complexion is less engaging but demonstrably less demanding to live with.</p>
<p>Even on the motorway, there&#039;s a feeling that this supermini shames some upmarket saloons, such is the fluency of its ride at speed.</p>
<p>It’s a fluency the Polo GTI never seems like relinquishing, even as you begin to explore its capabilities on more threadbare A- and B-roads. This is not the most balletic chassis, but it is remarkably composed, turns in effortlessly, is nicely balanced, and the front axle generates so much grip and stability that you can confidently ‘back’ the car into corners on the brakes and bring the rear axle subtly into play.</p>
<p>That said, hot hatch diehards would willingly trade some of the car’s everyday usability for a fraction more steering weight and closer vertical body control (lateral roll is rarely, if ever, an issue in the Polo GTI).</p>
<p>Millbrook’s hill route is precisely the sort of environment where, as a performance-biased supermini, the Polo GTI should shine. And, in the main, it does, albeit with a sense of imperturbability rather than excitement.</p>
<p>It lacks the body control of the old Fiesta ST and the steering response of a hot Mini, but it’s the most fluid of the three when driven briskly rather than flat out, working its contact patches supremely hard via a combination of its sophisticated suspension architecture and Continental tyres.</p>
<p>While the ESP can&#039;t be entirely disabled, in Sport mode it permits enough yaw for the chassis to feel adjustable through tighter bends. Overall, it’s a quick, competent performance, even if the long gearing does hamper proceedings a touch.</p>
<p>Supple but controlled damping characteristics mean this car’s metier is at about seven- or eight-tenths, ultimately, and driven as such it will make fast and sure-footed (but not particularly enthralling) progress along any road you care to point it down.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that the lack of a mechanical limited-slip diff is not felt too keenly. Rarely does the Polo GTI invite its driver to push so hard that the electronic torque-vectoring ‘XDS’ front axle wilts into understeer.</p>
<p>Commendably versatile this Volkswagen may be, but it could be significantly sharper.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33122-vwpologtideansmith29.jpg" width="4127" height="2750" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volkswagen originally offered the hot Polo in regular GTI and generously loaded GTI+ forms, but at the 2021 facelift it consolidated these into one package.</p>
<p>As of 2025, prices start at £30,740. That would have been an absurd amount back in 2018, but when the Honda Civic Type R is £52k, it seems reasonable – and its only real rival, the Mini JCW, is a touch pricier at £33,265.</p>
<p>Standard equipment covers that 8.0in touchscreen infotainment system; the 10.25in digital dial display; adaptive cruise control; front and rear parking sensors; a parking camera; lane keeping assistance; automatic wipers; and 17in alloy wheels.</p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/original-33119-vwpologtideansmith21.jpg" width="3529" height="2351" alt="Volkswagen Polo GTI rear driving" title="Volkswagen Polo GTI rear driving" /></p>
<div>
<p>We began this test by asking whether the Polo GTI was a throwback of the good or bad kind, and we certainly can conclude that it&#039;s the former.</p>
<p>It wasn&#039;t the most thrilling car of its type when it emerged in 2018, but it was certainly no duffer – and the fact that it still exists, when all but one of its comrades have fallen, is cause for celebration indeed.</p>
<p>There is fluidity, composure and no small measure of class in the way this supermini conducts itself along the full spectrum of British roads.</p>
<p>If a car like this still tickles your fancy, grab one while you can.</p>

<p><a href="/car-reviews/bmw">BMW</a> Group has fitted a <a href="/car-review/bmw/i7">BMW i7</a> with a solid-state battery as it ramps up testing of the next-generation technology.</p>
<p>Working with partner Solid Power, the pack – known as ASSB, for all-solid-state battery – uses cells that yield a higher density but which are smaller and lighter than those in the lithium ion batteries used by BMW today. In simple terms, this means more energy can be stored in smaller pack sizes.</p>
<p>This prototype pack also uses the current Gen5 architectures’ construction principles – prismatic cells in modules, rather than the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/bmw-neue-klasse-platform-reduce-price-evs-and-add-range">more advanced Gen6 Neue Klasse bolted-to-pack cylindrical cells</a> - that have been adapted in order to house Solid Power’s ASSB cells. </p>
<p>This suggests the group&#039;s current platforms could be modified to take the next-generation technologies in a push to bring solid state batteries to market quicker than had previously been expected. </p>
<p><span>Speaking in February, Martin Schuster, BMW Group’s vice-president of next-generation battery tech, told Autocar <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/bmw-says-its-eight-years-away-needing-solid-state-battery">that the group was eight years away from needing a solid-state battery </a>option in its EV line-up. Schuster said that whlie solid-state battery tech could be used now, the group&#039;s </span>main focus was to continue the development of lithium ion batteries. He added there was still “a long way to go” with current battery technology.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw-i7-solid-state_0.jpg?itok=pu0owgyl" width="900" /></p>
<p><span>However, the new test vehicle shows the group&#039;s "technology-open mindset", according to Schuster, who added: "We are continuously advancing the development of new battery cell technologies."</span></p>
<p>The car will now be tested over the coming months to gather information on temperature and operating pressure, said BMW.</p>
<p>Solid-state batteries are widely thought to be the holy grail of EVs and crucial to their longevity: they offer greater capacity and more range than similar-sized batteries in use today. Their simplified make-up is lighter and less susceptible to temperature variations, and they can be charged more quickly.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement follows that of rival <a href="/car-reviews/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/mercedes-benz-tests-solid-state-battery-620-mile-range">claimed it was close to putting the technology into production</a>.</p>

<p>The new <a href="/car-review/fiat/grande-panda-electric">Fiat Grande Panda</a> 4x4 concept previews a revival of the cult classic go-anywhere supermini and the latest expansion of the Italian firm’s fast-growing line-up.</p>
<p>The original Panda 4x4 was launched in 1983 and quickly became a cult classic, thanks to the raised ride height and rugged styling elements that made it an affordable off-roader.</p>
<p>The revived concept is based on the new Grande Panda, which is offered with both 111bhp electric and <span>108bhp</span> 1.2-litre mild-hybrid petrol powertrains and sits on Stellantis’s cost-conscious new Smart Car platform.</p>
<p>While Fiat hasn’t officially confirmed production intent, it refers to the Grande Panda 4x4 as “the next chapter” in its legacy and a “potential true symbol of versatility, reliability and freedom”.</p>
<p>Fiat Europe boss Gaetano Thorel wouldn&#039;t outright confirm the machine would reach production, but said: "Surely we will have this car on the road in the future – but not tomorrow." He added that there had been demand for a 4x4 version since the Grande Panda was first revealed, and the firm had a desire to meet that demand. </p>
<p>While full details about the concept&#039;s powertrain haven’t been revealed, Fiat does refer to it as offering an “electrified innovative rear axle”.</p>
<p>Thorel said that Fiat engineers were still working on the potential four-wheel-drive powertrain and refused to give details on whether any production 4x4 would be electric or combustion-based. However, it would use the Smart Car platform and Fiat insiders hinted would have an electric motor powering the rear axle, although details of that unit&#039;s size have yet to be confirmed. It could be a smaller e-axle that adds supplementary power only when required.</p>
<p>A similar mild-hybrid arrangement is employed by the rival <a href="/car-review/dacia/duster">Dacia Duster 4x4</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Fiat Grande Panda 4x4 rear quarter" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/fiat-grande-panda-4x4-concept-rear-quarter.jpg?itok=_Ard4lOA" /></p>
<p>The Grande Panda 4x4 concept features several bespoke design cues, including a dark red paint that echoes a special edition of the original Panda 4x4.</p>
<p>There are also steel wheels; special graphics on the doors that emphasise the stamped Panda lettering and evoke traditional off-roader body cladding; a protective underbody skidplate; and a roof rack.</p>
<p>Fiat has hinted that any production version would “most likely feature other accessories”.</p>
<p>The Grande Panda is intended by Fiat as a global car, and will eventuallty be manufactured in factories on three different continents. To meet those global requirements it can adopt a wide range of powertrains, including a manual pure ICE, a hybrid, full electric and even LPG. While the manual ICE is launching in Europe later this year it is not likely to be offered in the UK initially due to the extra costs of right-hand drive conversion.</p>

<p>A parliamentary report has criticised the absence of <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric car</a> charge points that fully satisfy new standards for disabled driver access, concluding that “the interests of disabled drivers have been left behind in the rollout”.</p>
<p>The Public Accounts Committee’s paper into the UK’s <a href="/car-news/advice-electric-cars/how-charge-electric-car">EV charge point network</a> also claimed that of the 15,000 rapid and ultra-rapid charge points in the UK, none is fully compliant with BSI PAS 1899, a standard created partly by the Department for Transport (DfT) to improve the charge point experience for disabled drivers by making chargers safer and more accessible.</p>
<p>Explaining the challenges facing disabled users, the committee wrote: “By 2035, 1.35 million drivers with disabilities are expected to be partially or wholly dependent on public charge points, but many charge points, or their surrounding environment, have features which make them inaccessible.”</p>
<p>It noted that these challenges include charge points being placed near obstructions, such as kerbs, which make it harder for wheelchair users to use, or the weight of the cable/force needed to attach the connector being too great.</p>
<p>The report went on to conclude: “Failure to address problems with the uptake of the standard will mean that the public charge point network will continue to develop without meeting the needs of drivers with disabilities.”</p>
<p>In response to the findings, Nigel Fletcher, CEO of the Motability Foundation, a charity that has been advocating for PAS 1899 to be recognised as the legal standard for charge points, argued that while ultimately it is a decision for the government, “providers of public charging should also be taking responsibility for ensuring their infrastructure is accessible”.</p>
<p>While the Motability Foundation agreed with the committee’s report, it said it cannot verify the claim that there are no charge points that comply with the standard, given there are no requirements for operators to collect and share data on accessibility. It did, however, agree the number was low.</p>
<p>For example, in March Instavolt opened a new ultra-rapid charging site in Hampshire. Each of the facility’s 44 charging bays are larger than standard charging bays, to improve access and safety for disabled users.</p>
<p>The Winchester Superhub has up to 1.8 metres of additional access and wheelchair manoeuvring space around each bay. In addition, payment terminals and screens are at a more convenient height for wheelchair users, while swing arms extending from the chargers support the weight of charging cables.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, and in advance of the standard’s publication in 2022, charging company Osprey launched what it claimed was the UK’s first accessibly designed rapid-charging hub. It followed this with improvements to its existing compact and hub sites that included creating larger bays, removing kerbs and installing more accessible hardware.</p>
<p>The opening of another accessible charging site, especially given the size of Instavolt’s 44-acre Superhub in Winchester, is good news for EV owners and future buyers, but it bears out another concern expressed by the Public Accounts Committee: the geographic disparity of charging facilities. The report said London and the south-east alone host 43% of all UK charge points.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it said, major roads in England’s southwest and in the north lack sufficient rapid-charger points, while it continues to be less commercially viable for charge point operators to serve rural areas.</p>
<p>“This raises concerns around regional divides and inequalities for different groups of drivers. Without action, it risks being baked into the rollout of charge points,” said the report.</p>
<p>The dominance of London and the south-east is also reflected in the distribution of the UK’s 15,000 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers. According to Zap-Map, by the end of February the region was home to around 3500, compared with major regions including the north-west and the West Midlands with around 1500 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers each. The north-east had barely more than 500.</p>
<p>Another concern raised by the report is that, as of January, approximately one-third of the UK’s 117 motorway service stations had yet to meet the DfT’s target of having six or more ultra-rapid chargers. “Charge points need to be installed in advance of need,” noted the report.</p>
<p>It suggested the shortfall might be explained by the fact that not one penny of the DfT’s Rapid Charging Fund (RCF), which was created five years ago to help finance grid connections on the strategic road network and is worth £950 million, has yet been spent.</p>
<p>ChargeUK, the organisation representing charging companies, welcomed the report but claimed that charger rollout was actually running ahead of demand. CEO Vicky Read said members wanted to increase the pace of installations but faced “delivery barriers”.</p>
<p>The DfT insisted it was rolling out the UK’s charge point network at “lightning pace”, with “a new one added to the network every 29 minutes”.</p>
<p>Regarding the unspent RCF, the DfT spokesperson said: “The market has changed significantly since the fund was announced in 2020. We launched a pilot project to better understand where we should target support and will apply learnings from it to continue boosting charging infrastructure on the strategic road network.”</p>
<p>Melanie Shufflebotham, founder and CEO of ZapMap, which plots charge points across the UK, said that, overall, the number had grown in proportion to the number of new EVs on the roads. But she warned that “local and regional areas are the challenge”, adding: “For example, Wales and Northern Ireland are lagging behind.”</p>

<div>
<p>Prices of some <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-cheap-used-electric-cars">used EVs</a> have nose-dived in recent years, which means you can get your hands on a premium model for far less than you might think.</p>
<p>So how does a luxurious, comfortable and handsome <strong>Jaguar I-Pace</strong> sound for less than a new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/dacia/spring">Dacia Spring?</a></p>
<p>That’s right: you can snap up the British brand’s sleek<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars"> electric car </a>from as little as £12,000, which is a steal when you consider that when new Jaguar’s first electric car cost as much as £80,000, once a few optional extras had been thrown in.</p>
<p>Under the floor is a 90kWh lithium ion battery that has a claimed WLTP range of up to 292 miles (more than its <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi">Audi</a>, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla">Tesla</a> rivals and still competitive today).</p>
<p>Even if that’s more like 200-250 miles in the real world, depending on the conditions and driving style, it should be enough for a week dropping the kids off at school, commuting to work and then an extended motorway trip at the weekend.</p>
<p>The I-Pace’s maximum charging speed of 100kW was fast when new, if slightly lethargic these days, and if you need to top up the battery en route then a 10-80% charge should take 40 minutes or so.</p>
<p>You’ll seldom need to use a public charger if you’ve got a wallbox at home, though: a 7kW charger will replenish the battery while you sleep, and it will be much cheaper.</p>
<p>Beyond its decent <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advice-electric-cars/longest-range-electric-cars">range</a>, the Jaguar is an enjoyable EV to drive. Its precise steering, neatly tuned suspension and low centre of gravity mean it’s more agile than you might think, given its SUV styling.</p>
<p>There’s a real sense of poise and precision on a fast, flowing road, with precision aided by its two driven axles and brake-based torque vectoring.</p>
<p>Outputs from the two motors are a combined 394bhp and 512lb ft, giving a punchy sub-5.0sec 0-62mph time when conditions (and battery charge) allow, but just as impressive is how comfortable and quiet the I-Pace is when you dial things back.</p>
<p>Its intuitive adaptive dampers soak up road imperfections well and isolate passengers from pothole-strewn roads, and the cabin’s high-quality materials and slick touchscreens make it feel every inch the new-age <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-luxury-cars">luxury </a>saloon.</p>
<p>It still looks almost as fresh as when it was first revealed almost 10 years ago. The Pivi Pro infotainment system is intuitive, and over-the-air updates ensure that all cars get the latest features.</p>
<p>Despite the rakish roofline, there’s plenty of head and leg room for taller passengers in the back – and don’t worry about fitting in luggage or a buggy, because there’s a 505-litre boot, too.</p>
<p>All versions are impressively well equipped – even entry-level S comes with comfort seats and LED headlights – but mid-rung SE is the sweet spot: it costs similar money to the S (from around £17,000) and gets extras such as 20in wheels, 10-way adjustable sports seats and extra safety kit, such as auto emergency braking.</p>
<p>You could go all out on the range-topping HSE, which gets plusher leather, and a 360deg reversing camera, but you’ll pay more than £20,000 for a clean example with around 25,000 miles on the clock.</p>
<p>Of course, there are rivals that will travel further on a charge or carry more stuff, but if you want an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-suvs">electric SUV </a>that’s fun to drive, comfortable and trumps the likes of Tesla, Audi and Mercedes for luxury appeal, it’s the Jag you should bag.</p>
</div>

<h2>Reliability</h2>
<div>
<h2>Is the Jaguar I-Pace reliable?</h2>
<p>And as always with JLR products, the spectre of unreliability looms large. Despite promises of improved quality, its products consistently finish near the bottom of reliability surveys.</p>
<p>Reliabilty is always hard to judge, but when we tested the car in 2023, it suffered an air suspension fault that made the ride even more unyielding than normal. There was a rattle coming from one of the A-pillars as well.</p>
<p><strong>Battery: </strong>Be wary of 2019-model-year cars fitted with LG Energy Solution batteries: these can overheat and potentially catch fire. Around 264 are subject to a recall, and JLR has offered affected owners to either replace the battery or buy the car back. Check if there’s an outstanding recall on the car before you make a purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Charging:</strong> Make sure the charging port opens and the cable locks onto the car when you plug it in to charge. The flap can sometimes fail to open, and a sticky port actuator pin means the cable might either fail to lock in or refuse to pull out.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Out-of-date software can cause various issues, such as the charging port not opening, battery management failures, random warning lights and infotainment system glitches.</p>
<p><strong>Interior:</strong> Look out for water ingress in the passenger footwell and in the frunk, typically caused by a broken windscreen or door seal. Tepid air-con could mean the compressor pipes are leaking. It’s a known fault but can cost around £1500 to replace.</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> Check that the electric door handles retract fully when you unlock the car. A new door handle is often the best solution; they can be replaced under warranty.</p>
<h2>An owner&#039;s view</h2>
<p><span><strong>Daniel Wood:</strong> </span><span>“I purchased my 71-reg I-Pace HSE back in August last year from a Jaguar main dealer. The reason I went for an I-Pace was the massive depreciation from new and how well it drove compared with rivals in the same price bracket. Mine is fitted with the adaptive air suspension – it’s a worthwhile option because I found the ride a bit bouncy on standard springs. I’ve had no issues so far, and OTA updates come up fairly frequently. Real-world range in my experience is 210-240 miles, but it can be expensive to charge publicly.”</span></p>
<h2>Also worth knowing</h2>
<p>Jaguar facelifted the I-Pace in 2023, with the electric SUV gaining various styling tweaks and revisions to the trim line-up. Technically it was unchanged from the original car.</p>
<p>The 90kWh battery pack in the I-Pace is covered by an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty.</p>
<p>You can download JLR’s InControl Remote smartphone app, which gives you control of your I-Pace from your phone so you can pre-heat both the battery and the car’s cabin on cold winter mornings.</p>
<p>Service intervals are set at 21,000 miles or every two years, but with fewer moving parts than an ICE Jaguar, it’s mainly the obvious consumables that will need attention.</p>
</div>
<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/01-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-front-driving.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="01 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 front driving" title="01 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 front driving" /></p>
<div>
<p>Jaguar claimed that the Jaguar I-Pace took aesthetic inspiration from the <a href="/car-review/jaguar/c-x75-2013-2015">C-X75</a> concept.</p>
<p>You might wonder what an electric family car could possibly have in common with a turbine-powered hybrid hypercar, but the similarities did exist.</p>
<p>Both featured cab-forward proportions, and both had similar broad, Tarmac-sniffing snouts and a commensurately low, vented bonnet.</p>
<p>The rear of the I-Pace was more of a departure, being tall and squared off for a commendably low drag coefficient of 0.29. Incidentally, it was Jaguar design director Ian Callum’s least favourite element, although to our eyes it gave the car a rakishly robust, super-distinctive and appealing visual character.</p>
<p>The I-Pace took full advantage of its electric architecture. It was exactly a centimetre longer than the <a href="/car-review/jaguar/xe">Jaguar XE </a>and yet its wheelbase eclipsed that of the <a href="/car-review/jaguar/xf">Jaguar XF</a>. It presented itself as an SUV but sat conspicuously low to the ground by the standards of such cars – and it was also supercar-wide, at 2139mm, including mirrors.</p>
<p>Even after its facelift, it still looked like nothing else. It had a round of technical updates in 2020, and in 2023, the front ‘grille’ became a solid panel.</p>
<p>Underneath the aluminium bodywork sat an electric powertrain of predictable architecture. A ‘skateboard’ battery pack (423 lithium ion cells, liquid cooled) of 90kWh was spread below the cabin floor and sat entirely within the car’s wheelbase for a claimed 50:50 weight distribution (53:47 as tested).</p>
<p>It drove a lightweight permanent-magnet electric motor on each axle. Each drove through a single-speed epicyclic transmission and open differential (there is brake-based torque vectoring in lieu of a locking diff) for maximum compactness.</p>
<p>At low speeds, the I-Pace was powered by just one of its motors, though both could combine to deliver 394bhp and 512lb ft through all four wheels, and a claimed 0-60mph time of 4.5sec – the latter coming despite a claimed 2133kg kerb weight, which presented as 2236kg on the scales in the case of our test car.</p>
<p>Range for the I-Pace was quoted at 292 miles, and fell to 255 miles for the 400 Sport, with its 22in wheels. When it launched, its ability to rapid charge at up to 100kW was quite a standout feature, but that&#039;s slow by today&#039;s standards. </p>
<p>At launch, AC charging topped out at 7kW, but the 2020 update added 11kW three-phase charging.</p>
<p>As standard, the I-Pace was equipped with a passive steel coil suspension set-up. Adaptive air suspension (which lowered the car beyond 65mph for a more aerodynamic stance and could raise it at low speeds for greater ground clearance) and adaptive dampers (for an even more driver-configurable drive) were available as an option. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/07-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-dashboard.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="07 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 dashboard" title="07 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 dashboard" /></p>
<div>
<p>“The best <a href="/car-review/jaguar">Jaguar</a> cabin in years” was how one tester described the Jaguar I-Pace’s interior, a claim that – for the most part – was entirely warranted in 2018 and still mostly holds up today.</p>
<p>Material selection was key here. Gloss black and metal panelling sit alongside leather-upholstered surfaces, physical controls and touchscreens for a sense of slick modern sophistication.</p>
<p>The facelifted F-Pace in particular featured plusher dashboard materials and there were only one or two other material low points among the car’s minor switchgear.</p>
<p>These low points were few and far between, however, with the I-Pace showcasing excellent standards for perceived quality and material richness. </p>
<p>The car’s ergonomics were also very good. Optional ‘performance seats’ provided plenty of lateral support, while their 14-way electronic adjustability and memory settings streamlined the process of settling in behind the wheel.</p>
<p>They were a bit overkill for an SUV, however, and rather firm, so we’d avoid them. They were standard on the 400 Sport trim, though.</p>
<p>Those in the back reaped the benefits of that cab-forward design and lengthy wheelbase; there was executive saloon levels of leg room on offer, while head room wasn&#039;t in short supply even with the fixed panoramic roof optioned.</p>
<p>The boot, meanwhile, was a useful 656 litres, while under the bonnet there was an additional 27-litre storage bin. Good luck fitting anything other than a laptop bag in here, though. </p>
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
<p><img alt="11 Jaguar i pace sport 400 rt 2023 multimedia 0" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/11-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-multimedia_0.jpg?itok=s1i0T4Pi" width="900" /></p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, the I-Pace hadn&#039;t changed a great deal, but thankfully Jaguar had fundamentally upgraded the multimedia system when it was facelifted in 2023.</p>
<p>The laggy, unintuitive system of the early car was easily the weakest aspect of the I-Pace’s entire cabin.</p>
<p>The Pivi Pro system that featured from 2020, while squeezed on to a smaller screen, worked well. It was fairly (but not perfectly) responsive and the menus were logically laid out.</p>
<p>Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto worked wirelessly, and rather than take over the whole show, they integrated neatly with the native interface, for instance showing album art and playback controls on the home screen.</p>
<p>Rich-sounding Meridian sound systems were standard across the board, with an 825W surround sound system available as an option.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/17-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-alternative-tracking-performance.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="17 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 alternative tracking performance" title="17 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 alternative tracking performance" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>When we road tested the Jaguar I-Pace in 2018, we noted that it was the manner in which it picked up pace from urban speeds that made it seem special.</p>
<p>Nowaays, we’re all well accustomed to the way EVs zoom up to everyday speeds and make gaps in traffic so much easier to go for than when you have to wait for a gearbox to make up its mind.</p>
<p>Even so, the I-Pace’s two-way-average 0-60mph time of 4.5sec still marked it out loud and clear as a seriously fast family car, being not far off the <a href="/car-review/ford/mustang-mach-e-gt">Ford Mustang Mach-e GT</a>’s 4.2 sec.</p>
<p>With our timing gear rigged up, the electric Jaguar clocked a 30-70mph time of just 3.5sec. Admittedly, that was not quite super-saloon levels of pace, but the fact that the last <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg/c-63-coupe-black-series-2012-2013">Mercedes-AMG C63 Black Series</a> was only 0.2sec quicker reinforced just how potent a thing the I-Pace was.</p>
<p>Acceleration off the line was deliciously constant and linear, pushing you back into those firmer performance seats with some force. The only caveat was that there seemed to be a brief scrabble for traction at the front end, as the I-Pace’s 2.2-tonne weight shifted backwards.</p>
<p>What was also impressive about the I-Pace was that despite being one of the first serious modern EVs, it got the regen and braking equation mostly right.</p>
<p>We would have liked paddles behind the steering wheel for ultimate control, but the I-Pace let you choose between a low and a high setting, the latter of which would bring the car to a complete stop. The brake pedal, when you did use it, was progressive and easy to modulate.</p>
<p>Under emergency-stop conditions, with the full extent of the brake pedal’s travel being exercised, the I-Pace wouls pull to a halt from 70mph in 46.7m on a dry stretch of road. The heavier, more powerful Model S, on the other hand, required 51.7m on a damp track.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/18-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-front-cornering.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="18 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 front cornering" title="18 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 front cornering" /></p>
<div>
<p>The <a href="/car-review/jaguar">Jaguar</a> I-Pace was milestone in the dynamic development of electric cars when it lauched in 2018. </p>
<p>Until it came along, the genre had been hamstrung by its inability to deliver anything offering satisfactory levels of feel, agility or engagement. But where there had been mostly darkness, the I-Pace brought light. Few better it even today.</p>
<p>Jaguar’s electromechanical steering not only possessed pleasing heft, but also weighted up in a linear fashion. It was just about quick enough as well to yield an agility unknown to cars this heavy, and so in the I-Pace you flowed through direction changes with an economy of movement that came as a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Even after driving more sporting EVs, the tactility of the I-Pace’s steering and the alacrity with which it changed direction remained a thing of wonder. </p>
<p>Of course, weight was the biggest dynamic barrier for electric cars, and yet the Jaguar managed well here too. By electric car standards it was actually quite trim and of course most of the weight sat low down.</p>
<p>On its optional air suspension, even committed cornering was dispatched with impressively little body roll and a neutral balance that was alien to those familiar with a <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-s-plaid">Tesla Model S</a>.</p>
<p>There was some throttle adjustability, too, and through corners you got the welcome sensation of the car confidently pushing itself along – up to a point, because the stability control couldn&#039;t be completely defeated and there was ultimately too much power going to the front wheels for any exuberant behaviour.</p>
<p>Still, you&#039;d need a <a href="/car-review/porsche/taycan-sport-turismo/first-drives/porsche-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-2022-uk-first">Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo</a> or a <a href="/car-review/kia/ev6/first-drives/kia-ev6-gt">Kia EV6 GT</a> to have more fun behind the wheel of a high-riding EV, and neither of those were direct rivals, strictly speaking.</p>
<h2>Comfort and isolation</h2>
<p>Less delicate was the ride quality. With so much weight and power to contain, and the expectation that a Jaguar was a sporting car, it was almost inevitable the I-Pace would seem firm in most driving scenarios.</p>
<p>In our experience, the I-Pace’s ride, if not styling, benefitted quite a bit from a more modest wheel choice. It would always fidget over bigger intrusions and body movements were sometimes dealt with a touch too abruptly for our liking.</p>
<p>Driving the Sport 400 on 22in wheels, one tester likened it to a <a href="/car-review/porsche/911-gt3">Porsche GT</a> model. It was never harsh or uncouth, just unrelentingly firm.</p>
<p>It was also a touch disappointing that the I-Pace wasn’t quite as hushed out on the motorway as you might have expected an electric vehicle to be, particularly one positioned towards the more expensive end of the market.</p>
<p>At a 70mph cruise, our sound meter recorded cabin noise at 66dB when we road tested it in 2018 on 20in alloys. That was 2dB more than the very quiet <a href="/car-review/audi/e-tron">Audi E-tron</a> (tested before its transformation to <a href="/car-review/audi/q8-e-tron">Audi Q8 E-tron</a>). On the 22in wheels of the 400 Sport we tried in 2023, road noise is more noticeable still. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/01-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-lead-driving.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="01 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 lead driving" title="01 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 lead driving" /></p>
<div>
<p>When the I-Pace launched, its 100kW rapid charging capability far exceeded that of the chargers commonly found on the UK motorway network.</p>
<p>Just a few years later, 150kW and 350kW units became the norm, and the I-Pace’s 100kW capability looks rather weedy compared with many rivals. The <a href="/car-review/audi/q8-e-tron">Audi Q8 E-tron</a> 50, <a href="/car-review/bmw/ix/first-drives/bmw-ix-xdrive40-m-sport-2021-uk-first-drive">BMW iX 40</a> and <a href="/car-review/lexus/rz">Lexus RZ 450e</a> can all take 150kW, while the <a href="/car-review/genesis/gv60">Genesis GV60</a>, <a href="/car-review/genesis/first-drives/genesis-electrified-gv70-2022-first-drive">Electrified GV70</a>, <a href="/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqe-suv">Mercedes EQE SUV</a> and the higher-spec versions of the <a href="/car-review/audi">Audi</a> and <a href="/car-review/bmw">BMW</a> can charge faster still.</p>
<p>Another area where EVs have moved on since the launch of the I-Pace is energy efficiency. The I-Pace was quite a big SUV with nearly 400bhp, so it was never going to sip the kWhs like a <a href="/car-review/fiat/500-electric">Fiat 500, </a>but cars like modern <a href="/car-review/tesla">Teslas</a> or the Genesis GV60 use less energy than the Jaguar. We managed 2.5mpkWh, which translated to a 211-mile range. </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/20-jaguar-i-pace-sport-400-rt-2023-verdict-static.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="20 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 verdict static" title="20 Jaguar i Pace Sport 400 RT 2023 verdict static" /></p>
<div>
<p>With its first all-electric model, Jaguar not only beat wealthier rivals to the punch but also set a high bar for those that came after it.</p>
<p>Even though it has had only had a few minor updates over the years, it was still competitive, even if it was now far from class leading.</p>
<p>While it was never quite the dynamic masterstroke that some might have hoped for, it could out-handle all of its direct rivals and entertain its driver like few others.</p>
<p>At the same time, it payed a significant price with ride quality that was more appropriate for a track-honed sports car than a luxury SUV. Ian Callum’s design hadn&#039;t aged a day, being progressive yet recognisably Jaguar.</p>
<p>The performance still holds up too, as does its roomy interior thanks to the fitment of a more modern multimedia system.</p>
<p>The I-Pace really shows its age is with its 100kW rapid charging, its lacklustre efficiency and very modest range. They don’t make Jaguar’s EV unrecommendable, but they will make many potential buyers think twice.</p>
<p>With an update of its battery and motor technology, and some minor dynamic fine-tuning – something Audi did with the E-tron – the Jaguar I-Pace could still be a world-class EV and the basis for a great range of cars. But as we know, that is not the path Jaguar has chosen.</p>

<p>The head of the UK’s largest tyre trade body has called on the Labour government to take urgent action to close legal loopholes that enable millions of exported used tyres to be burnt in India.</p>
<p>Darren Lindsey, who leads the British Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (BTMA) – a trade body that represents tyre manufacturers and retreaders – warns that politicians need to end the so-called T8 exemption and “introduce stricter controls and traceability measures”.</p>
<p>This, he said, would bring to an end the environmental and human harm when end-of-life tyres are sent for disposal to countries where regulatory and environmental standards do not align with the UK’s. According to official figures, of the 50 million tyres sent to waste every year, around half are exported.</p>
<p>It is the T8 exemption that allows these tyres to be sent abroad. The exemption is easy to apply for and approved without the need for a site inspection, and it was originally put in place for low-risk sectors, such as agricultural and recyclers, to allow them to process up to 40 tonnes of waste passenger car tyres per week without having to apply for a stricter environmental permit.</p>
<p>For example, they could process tyres into ‘bales’ – huge, compressed rubber cubes – and send them to be shredded and granulated in countries such as India. While this would be done in a similar manner to how they would be disposed of in the UK, it is a much cheaper alternative.</p>
<p>However, Lindsey said the loophole is instead being exploited by a growing minority of waste tyre collectors. He has called on the government to remove the exemption and introduce stricter controls and traceability measures to monitor the movement and disposal of these tyres.</p>
<p>A recent BBC investigation claimed that while these bales were being sent under a pretence of being correctly recycled, they were in fact being burnt by firms connected to India’s black market.</p>
<p>Burning tyres is illegal in the UK because, according to the Environment Agency, they emit hazardous smoke and pollutants. Instead, in the UK, end-of-life tyres must be handled by registered waste or recycling fi rms, which allows them to be tracked.</p>
<p>Lindsey said: “When you consider that the UK operates an unregulated free market system, and that the world is being hit with high energy prices, it creates the perfect storm for waste tyres, which have a high calorific value, to be shipped around the world. If the government, however, ends the T8 exemption, the trade in the 1000 tonnes of waste tyres that leave our shores every day would drastically reduce.”</p>
<p>It is a view largely shared by Peter Taylor, secretary general of the Tyre Recovery Association (TRA). However, he was keen to stress that “although tyre recovery in the UK is market-based, it is certainly not unregulated”.</p>
<p>“Sadly, the current regulatory regime is failing us,” he said. “T8 exemptions must end, and tyres exported for recycling should be shredded [instead of baled] to minimise poor practices in countries like India.”</p>
<p>Taylor has been campaigning to end the T8 exemption since 2018. He says those in breach are “a sizeable and still growing minority of collectors that are wilfully breaking the law”.</p>
<p>But there is much more at stake. Both the BTMA and the TRA are concerned the government’s apparent reluctance to act will cause irreparable damage to the UK’s tyre recycling industry.</p>
<p>“The UK has the capacity to recycle all of its waste tyres, or at least recycle 80% of them,” explained Taylor. “However, as long as the T8 exemptions exist, few will invest in the tyre recycling sector. The government needs to pass legislation quickly before the recycling infrastructure, and the supply chains that support it, are gone.”</p>
<p>In response, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said ministers are currently considering priorities for waste and resources, with proposed reforms including the removal of the T8 exemption.</p>

<p>The rush to <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> has generally coincided with a slowing down if not a complete pause in looking for breakthroughs in internal combustion engine development. Car makers’ pockets typically do not run deep enough to invest so heavily in parallel technologies.</p>
<p>Yet with EVs set to make up only half of all global sales by 2040, what about the other half? In the context of reducing emissions, Horse Powertrain CEO Matias Giannini asks: “Do we accept that 50% of cars being electric is enough?”</p>
<p>Surely, reducing emissions of all kinds every step of the way and at every opportunity is logical – and that’s where Horse comes in: “to continue to improve the other 50%”.</p>
<p>Not even a year old, Horse was spun out of the engine divisions of Geely (including <a href="/car-review/volvo">Volvo</a>) and the <a href="/car-review/renault">Renault</a> Group. It is a start-up with a difference: it is a profitable business that’s not looking for extra investment and it has already banked some rather large customers.</p>
<p>Giannini wants to help all car makers with engine design, development and manufacture. That includes everything from more traditional powertrains to compact hybrids that fit in the space of an electric motor in what were thought to be battery-electric-only architectures. Petrol-powered <a href="/car-review/renault/5">Renault 5</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>Any public opinion issues aside, the industry is stuck on engine development, says Giannini, because profits were ploughed into developing EVs that aren’t selling. The hybrid conversion for EVs in particular excites him and “is the only way OEMs are going to make money” on natively BEV models that have limited global appeal.</p>
<p>Brazilian-born Giannini is a mechanical engineer by trade and a self-confessed car guy. In a near-30- year varied career, he has worked on everything from brakes, suspension, chassis and powertrains across all different disciplines. In his most recent role, he did something similar to Horse at Continental, breaking out its engine operation as a stand-alone entity.</p>
<p>All of these experiences have resulted in what he calls this “mission” being “so appealing”. He says there is “definitely” more to come from ICE, including developments in precombustion, alternative fuels, material use, turbochargers, emissions and exhausts.</p>
<p>Thermal efficiency is another key area and in China in particular “there is a race for thermal efficiency”. He says: “Everybody is talking about it. Can we get to 43%, 45%, 46%? Who is going to have the best? Who knows how far we can get: 48%? Powertrain engineers say 50% is physically impossible, but I think there’s room to improve in that direction.<span>”</span></p>
<p>It’s easier to list who Horse isn’t speaking to, says Giannini, in partnering car makers that see the value in what he is offering amid “incredible” early progress. Don’t write off ICE just yet.</p>

<div>
<p>When the GTX badge was launched by Volkswagen in 2021, it was tipped as an electric equivalent of – and eventual successor to – the GTI line. But it has suffered by comparison: adding power and straight-line speed is easy on EVs and doesn’t make for an everyday performance hero. Now, with new management in Wolfsburg committed to GTI, it’s GTX that’s being phased out. Some irony, then, that the <strong>Volkswagen ID 7 GTX</strong> showcases exactly what the badge could stand for: a compelling take on what a warmed-up VW EV can be, with a distinct nod towards grand tourers and a different feel to GTI cars.</p>
<p>It helps that this new model has an excellent base to work from: in entry-level Pro form, the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-7">Vokswagen ID 7</a> was named Autocar&#039;s Best Saloon of 2024 and the best in a competitive class that also includes the Tesla Model 3. It&#039;s a refined, understated and well-rounded car, a better base to create a GTX model from than the earlier<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-4-gtx"> ID 4</a> and ID 5 SUVs.</p>
<p>So is the ID 7 GTX a true electric performance car or, as is often the car with hot EVs, would you be better off sticking to the base model?</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-02-rear-tracking.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 02 rear tracking" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 02 rear tracking" /></p>
<div>
<p>The ID 7 GTX features a four-wheel-drive powertrain. At the rear is the same 282bhp Volkswagen Group APP550 permanent magnet synchronous electric motor as in the standard Pro and Pro S versions. That&#039;s twinned with a new 107bhp asynchronous motor (designated AKA150) mounted on the front axle. </p>
<p>The rear motor is the primary drive unit, with the front one called upon when needed. If you were wondering, <span>Volkswagen</span> chose to use an asynchronous unit on the front axle because it claims this is more efficient when not being called upon to provide power.</p>
<p>Despite the two motors offering 282bhp and 107bhp respectively, total system output is capped at 335bhp. That&#039;s 53bhp more than the standard version of the ID 7 but significantly down on the 460bhp <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3 Performance</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially, the modifications made for this GTX model extend beyond simply adding more power than you could sensibly enjoy. The progressive steering has been tuned to offer more feel, with the electronic differential lock system also reworked. There has also been extensive work to broaden the variance in dynamics enabled by the Dynamic Chassis Control (fitted as standard in the UK). Notably, <span>Volkswagen</span> engineers say the big advances have come from developments of the system software.</p>
<p>The other big technical change is in the battery: the 77kWh pack used in the Pro model has been switched for an 86kWh one (also found in the long-range Pro S). It&#039;s a different design, with the pack containing 13 cell modules instead of 12. It means that in saloon form, the GTX offers a range of 364 miles.</p>
<p>The exterior styling changes that mark out the GTX from standard versions of the ID 7 are subtle but notable.</p>
<p>There&#039;s a new front bumper design exclusive to the performance line, along with revamped daytime running lights and a gloss-black front air intake. The bumper is aerodynamically styled to aid efficiency, while the front-end design now features a light-up VW logo as standard. </p>
<p>At the rear, there&#039;s a bespoke horizontal light strip (the rear VW badge illuminates as well) and customisable 3D-effect LED clusters.</p>
<p>On the saloon version, the lower area of the rear bumper features a honeycomb grille pattern and there&#039;s a notable diffuser. </p>
<p>The GTX sits on 20in wheels as standard, with 21in versions available as an option. There are also custom GTX wheel rim designs.</p>
<p>The GTX is also offered in Tourer estate form, which has an identical footprint and wheelbase to the saloon version but a bulkier rear end to accommodate a usefully larger boot.</p>
<p>The two machines are visually identical at the front and share identical mechanicals, but because of the greater surface area, the Tourer has a reduced – but still substantial – range of 357 miles.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-11-driving.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 11 driving" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 11 driving" /></p>
<div>
<p>The interior of the ID 7 GTX will be familiar to anyone who has sat in <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-7">a regular ID 7</a>. Although since this is a performance version, there are, of course, a range of styling upgrades designed to convey a dash of dynamism.</p>
<p>The custom Ergoactive front seats features a GTX-specific design, featuring a covering of a special microfibre material. There are also red decorative elements and GTX logos etched into the backrests. The steering wheel and other systems also feature red stitching elements.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, things are essentially the same as the regular ID 7, so there&#039;s a small digital cockpit with many of the displays moved to a large head-up display. Notably, Volkswagen has continued to work on the system, and so it can now display directions from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>
<p>The 15in infotainment touchscreen also remains, and many of the key controls of the car have been shifted to it. But as you can read in <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-7">our main ID 7 review</a>, everything is well laid-out and relatively easy to use.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is a car designed for long-distance driving, and the interior supports that purpose. It feels plush and premium without being overly fussy, and the low-slung driving position is excellent – enough to remind you why there should always be a place for saloons in this age of SUVs. </p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-20-performance.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 20 performance" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 20 performance" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>Under heavy acceleration, the GTX feels as quick as its claimed 0-62mph time of 5.4sec suggests – and unlike in many hot electric saloons or estates, enjoyment doesn’t come only in a straight line.</p>
<p>While it wants for power compared to rivals such as the Model 3 Performance, you would be very unlikely to notice unless you actually took them to a track for a drag race. In the real world, there&#039;s more than enough pace.</p>
<p>It&#039;s very usable, too. You get a big whack of power when you step on the accelerator, but it never feels uneven, and even under heavy loads the power is well-modulated. And if you need extra power while at speed, the ID 7 GTX will never be lacking for response.</p>
<p>Because the car favours its rear wheels, it maintains a touch of rear-drive bias. This means you can have some fun on a British country road, with it feeling responsive.</p>
<p>Mind you, much of the above can also apply to the single-motor Pro and Pro S models, and while they don&#039;t offer the same level of ultimate performance, you would be hard-pressed to really exploit the difference in everyday driving.</p>
<p>Our one big criticism with regards to driving the GTX quickly is the feel of the brake pedal, or rather the lack thereof. Incredibly light, it brought to mind old cars whose brakes had faded, denting my confidence to push on.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-21-scenic.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 21 scenic" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 21 scenic" /></p>
<div>
<p>The steering of the GTX doesn’t offer hot hatch levels of engagement, but it’s direct and responsive. To Volkswagen&#039;s credit, it isn&#039;t hammed up with extra weight or springiness to give a false impression of sportiness – a trap that makers of many warmed-up models have fallen into.</p>
<p>The car maintains its composure along fast, flowing roads, even when riding on big 21in wheels. It has an agility that belies its considerable 2328kg weight (which, by way of comparison it, makes it just 58kg lighter than the latest Volkswagen California camper van).</p>
<p>The Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) system has been tuned to offer a wider margin between the various driving modes, yet even in Sport the GTX has strong ride quality and maintains its composure well.</p>
<p>The dynamic management system works away in the background, calculating things like how much power to draw from each motor. It can also take more regen from the front motor in order to help the car turn in.</p>
<p>While the GTX offers a level of engagement that many hot EVs lack, it’s not an outright driver’s car. It’s an engaging GT that has plenty of appeal in the form of an executive saloon. </p>
<p>Again, a caveat would be that more standard ID 7 models run it closer. The GTX feels marginally sharper and more responsive, but it&#039;s not like the Pro and Pro S are dynamic slouches.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling like a true performance variant, such as the Golf GTI, this ultimately feels like a warmed-up range-topper for the regular ID 7 line-up. </p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-01-front-tracking.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 01 front tracking" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 01 front tracking" /></p>
<div>
<p>The GTX&#039;s 86kWh battery gives the saloon an official range of 364 miles and the estate a marginally inferior 357 miles. That&#039;s quite impressive in bare statistics, but in single-motor Pro S form, the ID 7 will achieve up to 440 miles.</p>
<p>Our experience suggests you should be able to achieve close to 300 miles in the real world – although doing so will obviously require you not exploiting the full potential of the powertrain.</p>
<p>The new battery also allows for faster charging, so you can top up the GTX at speeds of up to 200kW.</p>
<p>In the UK, the GTX is priced from £59,025, which is a substantial step up from the £51,005 for entry-level Pro and £54,490 for the Pro S, which shares the new 86kWh battery.</p>
<p>You can add about £750 to each of those prices if you want an estate body instead of a saloon one.</p>
<p>The GTX is at least well equipped for the outlay: standard equipment includes the adaptive chassis control, adaptive cruise control, a Harman Kardon sound system, an auto-dimming rear view mirror, 30-colour ambient lighting and the augmented reality head-up display.</p>
<p>An efficiency-boosting heat pump was originally a £1050 option in the UK, but since 2025 one has featured as standard.</p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw-id7-gtx-review-2024-23-rear-static.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="vw id7 gtx review 2024 23 rear static" title="vw id7 gtx review 2024 23 rear static" /></p>
<div>
<p>Overall, the GTX is a fast, refined and compelling package – and a far more rounded electric performance car than many of its rivals.</p>
<p>It showcases what the GTX badge can be: a family EV with a welcome dash of added performance and dynamism. Volkswagen has taken an already excellent car and added further dashes of power, engagement and comfort.</p>
<p>But there is a catch, and it&#039;s one that is familiar with performance EVs: if were were looking to buy an ID 7, we would be tempted to shop lower down the line-up. In its single-motor Pro and Pro S forms, the ID 7 is still enjoyable to drive, plenty fast enough for the real world and up to £10,000 cheaper. While the GTX makes a reasonable case for itself, the Pro S is almost as well equipped and offers 65 miles of extra range.</p>
<p>That said, if you like the idea of a warmed-up electric Volkswagen that can be a practical, long-range family hauler and do a good impression of a super-saloon, there&#039;s much to like here.</p>

<p>BMW has released the first images of a new model set to be revealed at the upcoming Villa d’Este Concours, seemingly fusing last year’s <a href="/car-news/new-cars/bmw-skytop-concept-set-limited-production">Skytop concept</a> with the famed ‘Clownshoe’ <a href="/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-bmw-z3-m">Z3 M Coupé</a>.</p>
<p>Images posted to social media show the silhouette of a model with the same rear lights as the Skytop, a rakish open-top GT unveiled at last year&#039;s Villa d’Este Concours, but a reworked tail section.</p>
<p>Rather than a long deck housing a convertible roof panel, it appears to be a shooting brake with a rakish glasshouse and a prominent ducktail-style roof spoiler.</p>
<p>Its form appears to reference the Z3 M as well as the <a href="/car-review/bmw/z4">Z4</a>-based <a href="/car-news/new-cars/bmw-z4-touring-concept-channels-spirit-z3-coupe">Touring Coupé concept</a> that <a href="/car-review/bmw">BMW</a> revealed at Villa d’Este in 2023.</p>
<p>The Touring Coupé never made it to production but the Skytop, on the other hand, is being readied for a limited run of 50 road-going cars.</p>
<p>Testing of these cars – based on the CLAR platform that underpins every BMW from the <a href="/car-review/bmw/3-series">3 Series</a> upwards and packing a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 – recently ramped up ahead of this year’s Villa d’Este Concours, which opens on 23 May.</p>
<p><img alt="BMW Skytop prototype rear quarter tracking" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw-skytop-prototype-rear-quarter-tracking.jpg?itok=K4cnLnk8" /></p>
<p>Discussing the impact of Villa d’Este, BMW M chief Frank van Meel last year told Autocar: “It is a little bit like a test balloon: you show the cars and, if there&#039;s enough demand, it can be built.</p>
<p>“I think the demand is quite high, so [the] probability is quite high. We will see over the next few weeks if that interest translates into purchasing orders.</p>
<p>“The probability is there. It shows [that] we always want to try new things and see if there is a demand. Even though we’re a big company, it’s not the main purpose to build a small series.</p>
<p>“But if you listen to your customers and they say every now and then to do something like this and we do it, I think it’s a nice gesture, to show that we aren&#039;t only into, let&#039;s say, the cars we build everyday, but we can also do something special if demand is there.”</p>
<p>BMW design director Adrian van Hooydonk added that “there’s no need to turn [the Skytop] into a big series production car” and that it is “maybe an instant classic”.</p>

<p>Mercedes-AMG is ramping up testing of its answer to the <a href="/car-review/lotus/eletre">Lotus Eletre</a> and <a href="/car-news/new-cars/porsche-cayenne-ev-lands-2025-and-ice-car-lives-past-2030">Porsche Cayenne Electric</a> as it primes its <a href="/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-amg-reveal-bespoke-electric-super-saloon-june">saloon counterpart</a> for a debut in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Currently known as the electric GT SUV (a name that could be carried into production), the super-SUV is set to reach UK forecourts in 2027. It&#039;s the first SUV that AMG has developed independently of Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>The EV will sit on the AMG.EA platform, which will be used first for the four-door production version of the Vision AMG saloon concept in 2026.</p>
<p>The platform will feature 800V electricals and advanced axial-flux electric motors in both twin- and tri-motor powertrains, with outputs well over 1000bhp expected to be offered.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="/car-news/electric-cars/british-motor-maker-yasa-become-ev-sports-car-superpower">Yasa, the Oxfordshire-based firm</a> owned by Mercedes-Benz, these motors each develop up to 480bhp and 590lb ft of torque and are seen by AMG as a key performance differentiator for its new SUV.</p>
<p>Among the performance benchmarks for the GT SUV is the 906bhp Lotus Eletre R.</p>
<p>The GT SUV will be heavily focused on road-going performance, but insiders have told Autocar it will offer variable ride height control to improve ground clearance in off-road use.</p>
<p>As for its styling, prototypes have revealed that its bold-looking design will incorporate elements that provide clear visual connections with its saloon sibling.</p>
<p>The front end is also set to feature a new interpretation of AMG’s Panamericana grille, together with distinctive headlights that include the three-pointed star graphics.</p>
<p>Flared wheel arches and wide rear haunches dominate the flanks, while retractable door handles – as seen on the <a href="/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqe-suv">EQE SUV</a> and <a href="/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqs-suv">EQS SUV</a> – increase aerodynamic efficiency.</p>
<p><img alt="Mercedes-AMG SUV camouflaged, front quarter, turning" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedes-amg-ev-suv-camo-front-quarter-2.jpg?itok=FNOQtHkU" /></p>
<p>Although AMG’s existing combustion-engined GLE-based models come in both SUV and SUV-coupé bodystyles, the new electric model will be offered solely in SUV form, with a “relatively upright tailgate and angled rear window” providing “the best balance between form and load-carrying space”, insiders have told Autocar.</p>
<p>Dimensionally, the GT SUV sits between the 4863mm-long EQE SUV and 5125mm-long EQS SUV.</p>
<p>Inside, it adopts a unique design for the dashboard and displays, together with new AMG.OS software.</p>
<p>“SUVs have been among our most popular models for many years,” AMG CEO Michael Schiebe previously told Autocar. “We are responding to this by offering customers a high-performance off-roader based on the AMG.EA platform. Our new high-performance architecture follows a clear philosophy: AMG first, EV second.”</p>
<p>AMG is remaining tight-lipped about the battery technology. However, Autocar has been told it will introduce a different chemistry combination to offer greater efficiency and a longer range than the existing nickel-manganese-cobalt battery used by existing electric AMG models.</p>
<p>Extensive development is also being done on heat management, especially around liquid cooling, to support much faster charging rates.</p>
<p>For reference, today’s EQE 53 4Matic+ uses a 90.6kWh (usable) pack that has a claimed maximum range of 321 miles and can support a charging speed of 170kW – good for a top up of 112 miles of range in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="Mercedes-AMG SUV camo rear quarter, tracking" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedes-amg-ev-suv-camo-rear-quarter.jpg?itok=2Xma2GgH" /></p>
<p>Additional new software developments and inverter technology developed in partnership with Mercedes’ High Performance Powertrain division in Brixworth are also on the way, Autocar has been told.</p>
<p>The new AMG SUV is underpinned by double-wishbone and multi-link suspension featuring the company’s newly introduced Active Ride Control system – a set-up also being readied for its new electric saloon.</p>
<p>Already incorporated on the current <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg/sl">SL</a>, <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg/gt">GT</a> and the latest evolution of the 45-year-old <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg/g-63">G-Class</a>, Active Ride Control features hydraulic pumps for each wheel to help reduce body roll while providing constant self-levelling properties.</p>
<p>Without traditional roll bars connecting the two opposing wheels front and rear, it can also isolate the compression and rebound characteristics at each wheel in a bid to improve the ride over AMG’s earlier suspension developments.</p>
<p>Additionally, this set-up will support an automatic reduction in ride height at higher speeds for added aerodynamic efficiency.</p>
<p>Production of the new SUV will take place alongside the upcoming saloon at Mercedes’ Sindelfingen facility in Germany.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>Jeep Avenger </strong>is now an intriguingly multifaceted little car – so it&#039;s little wonder that Jeep&#039;s UK sales figures have been rocketing up lately.</p>
<p>This <span>baby </span><a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-crossover-hatchbacks">crossover</a> was initially available exclusively as an impressive urban electric car, but now it also comes as a modest manual petrol, an electrified automatic petrol and a proper four-wheel-drive off-roader.</p>
<p>The basic 1.2-litre Avenger is available in three trim levels. Regrettably, though, even the cheapest of them is priced from £25,750 – considerably more than its admittedly less trendy <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/208">Peugeot 208</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/corsa">Vauxhall Corsa</a> siblings.</p>
<p>Adding an automatic gearbox brings with it a mild-hybrid system and raises the price by £1000.</p>
<p>The fully electric Avenger, with its 249-mile range, starts at £29,999. That car is reviewed separately <a href="/car-review/jeep/avenger-electric">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then from £31,219, there&#039;s the Wrangler-imitating <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/wrangler">4xe</a>, which gets 4WD by way of a second electric motor on the rear axle, and a Scrappy-Doo character from its beefier bumpers, roof bars, tow hooks and underbody cladding.</p>
<p>The model range currently tops out at £35,219 with a special edition of the 4xe created in collaboration with The North Face, a renowned maker of outdoor exploration gear.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-pan-13.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review pan 13" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review pan 13" /></p>
<div>
<p><span>Jeep says it&#039;s giving customers the "freedom of choice" with the Avenger&#039;s fourfold powertrain offering: manual petrol, automatic mild hybrid, 4WD full hybrid and fully </span><span>electric.</span></p>
<p>Despite their mechanical differences, the e-Hybrid looks virtually identical to the EV. The only noticeable change is the addition of a green ‘e’ badge to denote its electrification.</p>
<p>The manual petrol lacks this badging and looks rather plain at the rear, but at least it doesn&#039;t lose any of the Avenger&#039;s character.</p>
<p>The 4xe&#039;s stickers, cladding and roof bars give it away as the most outdoorsy of the Avengers, along with a 10mm suspension lift, a new multi-link rear suspension set-up for improved articulation, and the addition of some chunkier mud-and-snow tyres - or you can optionally upgrade them to even beefier all-terrains.</p>
<p>The manual petrol uses a 99bhp <span>turbocharged</span> 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine to hit 0-62mph in 10.6sec and go on to a top speed of 110mph. Jeep claims an economy figure of 50.4mpg. </p>
<p>The e-Hybrid is similar to other Jeep e-Hybrids in using a beefy mild-hybrid system. The same 1.2-litre Puretech engine is assisted by a 48V hybrid system, a 0.9kWh battery under the passenger&#039;s seat and a 28bhp electric motor in the six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. In all, its peak outputs stand at 127bhp and 151lb ft of torque.</p>
<p>The 4xe is powered by an unusual hybrid powertrain that combines that 1.2-litre Puretech engine again with a pair of 28bhp electric motors (one at the rear axle, one in the gearbox) for a total output of 143bhp and the capability to split torque output 50:50 across both axles.</p>
<p>Both of the 4xe&#039;s axles are driven at speeds of less than 18mph, but beyond that, the rear motor can be idled when it&#039;s not needed to maximise efficiency - which officially is similar to that of the front-wheel-drive <a href="/car-review/ford/puma">Ford Puma</a>. </p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-dash-27.jpg" width="1466" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review dash 27" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review dash 27" /></p>
<div>
<p>Inside, the manual petrol and the e-Hybrid are almost the same as the EV, save for blue &#039;e&#039; badges.</p>
<p>You sit high but have more than enough space and adjustment to find to your preferred driving position and all-round visibility is pretty good. </p>
<p>There&#039;s a 7.0in digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel or a 10.25in one on the top two specification levels. This sits alongside a 10.25in infotainment touchscreen, on which everything is laid out logically and the graphics are crisp enough. <a href="/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay-and-how-does-it-work">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto-and-how-does-it-work">Android Auto</a> are also included as standard. </p>
<p>Thankfully, the combustion-powered Avenger models are as spacious and practical as the electric one.</p>
<p>The centre console conceals a large storage area and the door pockets are roomy enough for a typical drinks bottle. The extremely useful shelf in front of the passenger remains in place too.</p>
<p>It&#039;s not quite as plush as the <a href="/car-review/kia/niro">Kia Niro</a> or <a href="/car-review/hyundai/kona">Hyundai Kona</a> inside, but the Avenger has its own character, which many drivers might end up preferring.</p>
<p>Don&#039;t expect especially spacious rear quarters, though, particularly not behind a taller driver. Because the e-Hybrid&#039;s battery is positioned underneath the driver&#039;s seat, foot space in the rear is slightly impacted there. </p>
<p>The boot is slightly larger here than in the electric Avenger, measuring 380 litres instead of 355 litres. It still lags far behind the Kona&#039;s 466 litres, though, and the 397 litres of the Toyota Yaris Cross. </p>
<p>It would be nice if the 4xe package extended to a more special treatment in the cabin. The off-roader gets a smattering of badges, some rubber floor mats and a more hard-wearing seat fabric but is otherwise identical to the standard car inside - and while it’s a sensibly arranged and quite comfortable cabin, it does feel a little basic in the context of a range-topper, and some of the physical Stellantis-group switchgear and graphical interfaces are starting to feel their age. </p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-front-corner-20_0.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front corner 20" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front corner 20" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>The 1.2-litre engine appears rather measly on paper, but by no means does it make life painful.</p>
<p>Even in the 99bhp manual, you can keep up with the flow of the traffic – although you really do have to go mining for torque at higher speeds. It&#039;s a good thing the clutch pedal and gearlever are both pleasant to use, then.</p>
<p>The automatic e-Hybrid has the same 99bhp total output but is torquier off the line, being bolstered by an E-Boost feature that adds 40lb ft of torque for an extra push in acceleration. </p>
<p>It also feels gutsier than the figures suggest in the mid-range. Indeed, Jeep says the e-Hybrid offers 30%-faster acceleration between 30-60mph than the manual petrol Avenger.</p>
<p>You can feel the difference on faster B-roads and motorways. However, the gearbox can disappoint, because it doesn&#039;t always shift up or down when you need it to.</p>
<p>The engine can sound quite gruff when you put your foot down too, in marked contrast to the near-slient serenity offered by the electric Avenger.</p>
<p>The e-Hybrid can drive for up to 1km (0.6 miles) on electric power alone, which is more than most mild hybrids but a long way short of a good full-hybrid system like <a href="/car-review/toyota">Toyota</a>’s.</p>
<p>Still, it comes in useful when you&#039;re manoeuvring or driving around town, and this is where the e-Hybrid excels, offering a refined and quiet driving experience when taking off from a set of lights or trundling through traffic.</p>
<p>In the 4xe, even with the assistance of a couple of electric motors, the engine remains a thrashy and strained one when pushing on, and the addition of a bit of extra power doesn’t translate to any great boost in pep: you feel every one of those 9.5 seconds on the way to 62mph.</p>
<p>At lower speeds, though, this a more refined system that manages gearshifts sensibly and transitions between electric and petrol power <span>smoothly and quietly </span>when you’re under way.</p>
<p>In keeping with its off-road aspirations, the 4xe is equipped with Snow and Sand & Mud drive modes with their own gearbox calibrations and traction control settings, while Sport mode liberates the full output from all power sources.</p>
<p>Pair this with &#039;manual&#039; shifts and the 4xe does a passable impression of a warm hatch on the twistier bits, although it still needs to be worked hard and the more outdoorsy rubber gets a bit scrabbly and screechy if you’re particularly boisterous. </p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-front-tracking-off-road-08.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front tracking off road 08" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front tracking off road 08" /></p>
<div>
<p>Because it doesn&#039;t have a large battery to carry around, the petrol Avenger is a lot lighter than the EV, and direct steering means it feels light and agile in the corners.</p>
<p>It can’t quite match the Puma for agility, though, and tighter corners cause some body roll and lean. It&#039;s not entertaining, although it is competent and neat.</p>
<p>The ride comfort is also acceptable. It&#039;s the seats that are the problem, their flatness and lack of lumbar <span>adjustment </span>making themselves known on rougher roads.</p>
<p>However, the e-Hybrid is a good option for long-distance driving. It&#039;s smooth a<span>t higher speeds</span>, even if the suspension can be thrown by lumpier surfaces.</p>
<p>Around town, it struggles to absorb rigid cracks and bumps. It can get a bit lairy, with larger bumps crashing into the cabin. </p>
<p>Happily, the 4xe&#039;s suspension lift doesn’t invite comical amounts of roll in corners and the chassis tweaks do little to dent the Avenger’s commendable cruising refinement and predictable steering.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they also don&#039;t do much to improve the slightly busy secondary ride, meaning shoddily finished surfaces can become slightly tiring after a while. </p>
<p>Naturally, the 4xe is more of a bridleway botherer than a Moab monster, but we were extremely impressed by its performance on a challenging off-road course. It handled severely rutted tracks capably, allowing for the odd knock on the underside and scrape of the skidplate (perhaps a few more milimetres of lift would be welcome) and maintained traction on even the loosest, slipperiest surfaces. Plus, the extra shove from the rear motor meant it could scamper up ascents that you would think possible only in something like the <a href="/car-review/land-rover/defender">Land Rover Defender</a>. </p>
<p>A low-range function and hill descent control are notable by their absence in the most unforgiving stretches, but only the hardiest of mountaineers would really miss them.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-front-corner-14.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front corner 14" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review front corner 14" /></p>
<div>
<p>The manual petrol officially averages 50.4mpg. That&#039;s pretty good going, but the e-Hybrid really entices with 57.6mpg. That&#039;s a chunk more MPG than the mild-hybrid Puma officially achieves (52mpg), and our test drive yielded a creditable 52.2mpg.</p>
<p>Even the 4xe is capable of returning more than 50mpg, according to WLTP figures, which makes it one of the most efficient combustion-engined 4x4s on the market.</p>
<p>Yet the real deal-maker is the e-Hybrid’s price, which boosts its credibility in a crowded sector. Although it’s more expensive than the manual petrol Avenger and is just beaten by the related Fiat 600 Hybrid<span>,</span> it matches the Puma Hybrid and undercuts the <a href="/car-review/peugeot/2008">Peugeot 2008</a> Hybrid. It’s also almost £10,000 cheaper than the Avenger EV. </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/jeep-avenger-4xe-2025-review-rear-static-19.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review rear static 19" title="Jeep Avenger 4xe 2025 Review rear static 19" /></p>
<div>
<p>So, should you choose a petrol Avenger over an electric one – or indeed another model entirely?</p>
<p>The manual petrol is certainly competent and appealing, with great style, a nice interior and an inoffensive drive. It&#039;s just a shame that it&#039;s so much more expensive than other superminis – even closely related ones.</p>
<p>The <span>e-Hybrid</span> is impressively efficient and just as easy to use around town – all while being £10,000 cheaper than the EV and never needing to spend time at a charger. We&#039;d say it&#039;s the most well-rounded version of the Avenger.</p>
<p>The 4xe, meanwhile, takes what&#039;s great about this little Jeep and adds a hit of genuine off-road ability that massively boosts its use case outside of the city - sacrificing just a little in the way of affordability and refinement. But ultimately, with the likes of the <a href="/car-review/suzuki/jimny">Suzuki Jimny</a>, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/suzuki/ignis">Suzuki Ignis</a> and <a href="/car-review/fiat/panda">Fiat Panda</a> 4x4 no longer available in the UK, the affordable compact off-roader is an endangered breed, so the 4xe is an especially welcome addition to the market.</p>

<p><a href="/car-reviews/citroen">Citroën</a> has appointed <a href="/car-reviews/volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> Group France boss Xavier Chardon as its new CEO, replacing Thierry Koskas from 2 June.</p>
<p>Chardon has been at the German firm since 2012 and in his most recent role since 2021.</p>
<p>Before joining Volkswagen, he spent almost 20 years at Citroën, most recently as its French boss between 2009 and 2011.</p>
<p>Koskas took over as head of the French brand at the start of 2023. He oversaw a pivotal patch that included a rebranding, the launch of new EVs and a line-up shake-up that included the launch of the new <a href="/car-review/citroen/c3">C3</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-citroen-c5-aircross-revealed-concept-styling-and-ev-option">C5 Aircross</a> flagship.</p>
<p><span>Chardon will report to </span>Stellantis COO Jean-Philippe Imparato, who is currently overseeing the multinational group <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-finance-and-corporate/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-resigns-%E2%82%AC3bn-wiped-groups">as it searches for a new CEO</a>.</p>
<p><span>Imparato said</span>: “I would like to thank Thierry Koskas for leading Citroën brand over the last two years and for achieving its line-up renewal, most recently with the presentation of the new C5 Aircross.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to welcome Xavier Chardon to the head of Citroën. His rich and diverse career, his expertise in the automotive sector and his knowledge of the brand will be valuable assets in leading Citroën towards new horizons and strengthening its unique position in the market."</p>

<p>Hyundai has started construction work on a new factory in Saudi Arabia that is set to supply the country with some 50,000 cars annually.  </p>
<p>It is based in the King Salman Automotive Cluster, a new automotive industry hub in the King Abdullah Economic City near Jeddah. As well as Hyundai, it currently hosts Lucid Motors (for which the Saudi government is a key financial backer) and Saudi brand Ceer.</p>
<p>It will produce both internal-combustion-engine and battery-electric vehicles according to local demand, and will build its first vehicle by October 2026. These will be assembled from knock-down kits, using parts sourced from Korea, reported business newspaper The Korea Times.</p>
<p>Ownership of the factory is split between the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which holds a 70% stake, and <a href="/car-review/hyundai">Hyundai</a>, with the remaining 30%.</p>
<p>The plant is forecast to generate some $5 billion (£3.8bn) to the Saudi economy within 20 years.</p>
<p>“We believe our role will be significant in this early stage of the industry’s development here,” Hyundai brand chief Jaehoon Chang told reporters at the groundbreaking ceremony.</p>
<p>Hyundai sold some 136,000 cars in Saudi Arabia last year.</p>

<p>With the ever-increasing number of SUVs on our roads, finding proper, dependable sources of driver entertainment isn&#039;t quite as easy as it once was.</p>
<p><span>It&#039;s especially hard to find a sports car on a real-world budget, but our list of the best affordable sports cars will help you find a phenomenal drive without breaking the bank.  </span></p>
<p>They may not be as numerous as before and many don’t seem as affordable in these inflationary times, but they exist, and they’re cars that demand to be seized and cherished.</p>
<p>Despite their price, some of them are the <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-sports-cars">best sports cars</a> you can buy, and among them are mid-engined two-seaters, front-engined roadsters, big-engined muscle cars and lightweight specials.</p>
<p><span>Some of these cars could easily serve as daily transport; for others, that would be the case only for the genuinely enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p>They share an affordable asking price – £50,000 or below in some cases, and quite a long way below in some - and the capacity to light up your motoring as often as the mood takes.</p>
<p>Our top pick is the Alpine A110, which is one of the most engaging, dynamic and enthalling cars money can buy today. </p>
<p>But what other models make it into our top ten list? Read on to find out... </p>
</div>
<h2>1. Alpine A110</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/alpine_a110_0.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> handling</p>
<p>Every significant part of the Alpine A110 driving experience, from the rasping turbocharged torque of its engine to the immersive poise and panache of its handling, is all about fun.</p>
<p>It brings to life journeys and roads that rivals don&#039;t and possesses seriously enjoyable driving dynamics. </p>
<p>The standard A110 arrived in 2017 to a rapturous welcome from critics and owners alike. The later Alpine A110 S brought a power rise from 248bhp to 288bhp (and it has subsequently climbed to 296bhp), firmer suspension and bigger brakes.</p>
<p>Various special editions, including the plush Légende GT, have come and gone. And now there&#039;s the range-topping, extra-specialised Alpine A110 R. But none has supplanted the entry-level A110 in our affections, which has such an enticing and delicate kind of poise, grip and body control.</p>
<p>Rarely does a car come along so devoted to driver involvement, and so singularly effective at it, even among affordable sports cars.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>2. Porsche 718</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_afforable_sports_cars_-_porsche_718_cayman.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>daily driving</p>
<p>The Porsche 718 remains by some distance the most complete mid-engined sports car on sale.</p>
<p>Whether fitted with a four- or a six-cylinder motor, be in no doubt: the Boxster and Cayman have always been, and remain, excellent.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s not forget the naturally aspirated flat-six engine in upper-level GTS, GT4 and Boxster Spyder models. It&#039;s a superb engine by any standards - based on the 3.0-litre unit in the &#039;992&#039; 911, only enlarged to 4.0 litres and shorn of the turbos.</p>
<p>Both the Boxster and Cayman remain practical, ever-engaging to drive, and plenty fast even in four-cylinder form.</p>
<p>The 718 still has it all - and it takes a car of once-in-a-generation dynamic brilliance to beat it.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>3. Ariel Atom 4</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_affordable_sports_cars_-_ariel_atom_4.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>driver engagement</p>
<p>Anyone with a £50,000 budget to spend on something in which they just want to enjoy themselves would be remiss in the extreme to overlook one of the most direct and glaringly obvious solutions to their brief: the utterly brilliant Ariel Atom 4.</p>
<p>This lightweight two-seater is part motorbike, part car, part tubular curio. But while demanding plenty of commitment from its driver, it’s superbly involving and characterful.</p>
<p>Our favourite lightweight sports car, the Atom keeps it focus squarely on the essentials. A windscreen is an optional extra - and if you don’t go for one, a helmet is an absolute must. </p>
<p>But huge pace and almost unrivalled excitement are this car’s crowning glories. The former comes from the car’s turbocharged Honda four-cylinder engine, which can be turned up as far as 350bhp in a car weighing little more than 600kg.</p>
<p>But the latter isn’t just about superbike-baiting acceleration. The Atom&#039;s chassis is singularly adjustable, and it can be made so easily to work every bit as well on a bumpy, flowing B-road as on a track day.</p>
<p>Getting on top of an Atom on the track and getting every scrap of performance from it is a challenge like few sports cars can offer in 2024. </p>
</div>
</p><h2>4. Mazda MX-5</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_affortable_sports_cars_-_mazda_mx-5.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>outright value</p>
<p>There isn&#039;t a single area in which this fourth-generation Mazda MX-5 fails to surpass its predecessor. It&#039;s shorter, lighter, more spacious and better laid out. It&#039;s sharper looking but still disarming and not at all ostentatious. It&#039;s also faster, more frugal and even more vibrant and engaging to drive.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mazda facelifted its iconic roadster, with the headline change being a 23bhp power hike for its feisty 2.0-litre engine. A steering column that also now adjusts for reach was also introduced, addressing one of the MX-5&#039;s only ergonomic drawbacks.</p>
<p>The entry-level 1.5-litre MX-5 still develops 130bhp, while the 2.0-litre model makes 181bhp but also gets a front strut brace, a limited-slip differential and uprated Bilstein dampers as standard. </p>
<p>Whichever you choose, rear-driven chassis poise and lots of driver involvement are guaranteed.</p>
<p>That’s because the MX-5 is still every inch the same zesty and inimitable car that it always has been. Its character hasn&#039;t really changed at all in three decades, and nothing on this list offers a better pounds-per-smile rating.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>5. Morgan Super 3</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/01-morgan-super-3-rt-2022-lead-front_1_0.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>thrills</p>
<p>The Super 3 (the 2012 reinvention, not the 1909 original) proved to be a surprise hit for the Malvern maker. Around 2500 left the factory over a 10-year production run, which for the nichiest of niche manufacturers is as close to mass production as it gets.</p>
<p>Thankfully, today&#039;s Super 3 oozes the same spirit and charm of its predecessor, yet comes in a far more versatile and modern package.</p>
<p>The unique three-wheel layout remains the same, as do the upturned bathtub looks, but under the skin, there&#039;s a stronger monocoque construction, more sophisticated suspension and a three-cylinder Ford Fiesta engine in place of a throbbing V-twin.</p>
<p>Tipping the scales at just 635kg, the 118bhp Morgan is brisk, its performance aided by a snickety five-speed manual sourced from the Mazda MX-5. Yet it&#039;s the way the skinny-tyred machine tackles corners that delivers the real delight, the modest grip levels and well-balanced handling making it huge fun at any speed - but especially accessibly so on the road.</p>
<p>Most lightweight specials offer greater outright pace and better circuit suitability than this, and the last 3 Wheeler had a bit more character, but when all you want to do is drive on the sort of roads that most of us use every day and grab every moment of joy you can while doing so, few cars will have your heart singing more loudly.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>6. Ford Mustang</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_afforable_sports_cars_-_ford_mustang.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>aural pleasure</p>
<p>The seventh-generation ‘Stang arrived late in 2024, and given we named it our Best Dream Car at our annual awards, we believe it&#039;s better than ever. </p>
<p>That said, the Mustang ownership experience has a few drawbacks in the UK. The car’s sheer size means you have to think twice about where you&#039;re going to park it in town and what kinds of country lanes you might seek out with it. </p>
<p>With its dipsomaniac 5.0-litre V8, meanwhile, you will need to factor in a greater number of visits to the pumps than your peers in their German sports cars. Ford of Europe used to offer a four-cylinder engine in the car to soften the blow on this front but has since discontinued it. </p>
<p>The Mustang is a throwback of a sports car, needless to say, yet few direct rivals have such obvious likability. Its powertrain brings with it an appeal that engines with fewer cylinders simply don&#039;t muster and its rear-drive chassis balance is pretty peachy too</p>
</div>
</p><h2>7. Caterham Seven</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/caterham_seven.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>simplicity</p>
<p>For more than 70 years, the Caterham Seven in all its forms (Lotus and Caterham) has been setting a defining standard for pure driver thrills.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about refinement, disregard modern crash-safety tests and wonder instead what kind of sports car will entertain you most widely and vividly wherever you happen to be, this diminutive British sports car is hard to beat.</p>
<p>The most affordable way into a new Seven is the Caterham Seven 170, which starts at £28,990 if you&#039;re willing to wield the spanners and build it yourself.</p>
<p>With its 84bhp turbocharged 660cc Suzuki engine, the Caterham looks a little weedy on paper, but a kerb weight of as little as 440kg means 0-60mph can be done and dusted in less than 7.0sec, the gargling three-pot engine encouraging you all the way.</p>
<p>Above the Seven 170, Caterham now offers the retro-themed Super Seven 600 and Super Seven 2000. Extended front cycle wings and plenty of body chrome trim give these cars classic Seven looks, but they can still be bought and built in kit form, the latter offering 180bhp of Ford Duratec power.</p>
<p>Move up again and you’re into proper performance Caterham territory, where proper motorsport-ready models can be found with as much as 310bhp, sequential gearboxes, full roll cages, track-ready slick tyres and fully adjustable suspension systems.</p>
<p>Here, even the madcap Caterham Seven 620R could be yours, fully factory-built and ready to go, for a lot less than the price of a Porsche 718 Cayman GT4.</p>
<p>Cheaper Sevens get a live rear axle and lack the ride sophistication of the pricier De Dion-equipped cars, but with their skinny tyres and wrist-flick steering, they can still dance this way and that through corners, entertaining like only lightweight cars could.</p>
<p>The most innocent and exhilarating fun on four wheels? Quite possibly.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>8. BMW Z4</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_affordable_sports_cars_-_bmw_z4.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>interior quality</p>
<p>The BMW Z4 still the platform sibling of the Toyota Supra, but it&#039;s got its own trump cards to play that help it stand out. </p>
<p>It comes with the option of a drop-top, and its powertrain selection offers a little more versatility compared to other models on this list. </p>
<p>The range opens with a 194bhp variant, but the more sporty models come with 255bhp or a range-topping 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six engine, offering 335bhp and 369lb ft of torque.</p>
<p>The Z4&#039;s strengths are found in its handling and ride, which have been significantly improved over its predecessor, offering great levels of stability at high speeds. </p>
<p>A six-speed manual has also been made available since the start of 2024 (surprisingly, for the first time on this derivative) as part of the Handschalter Package, which also reconfigures the Z4&#039;s springs and dampers, and adjusts the model&#039;s steering mapping for a more engaging driving experience. </p>
<p>It might sometimes feel more like a drop-top cruiser than an out-and-out sports car, but that&#039;s okay. Sometimes it&#039;s important to relax with the knowledge you can leave most other cars for dead at a set of lights. </p>
</div>
</p><h2>9. Morgan Plus Four</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_affordable_sports_cars_-_morgan_plus_4.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>old-world charm</p>
<p>We’re stretching the bounds of qualification by including this car at the foot of our &#039;best affordable sports cars&#039; roster but with justifiable mitigation. Morgan currently sells its cheapest four-wheeled sports car, the Morgan Plus Four, from a whisker under £63,000.</p>
<p>But because it has become a modern sports car brand with all avenues catered to and because Morgan sports cars have an almost unrivalled ability to hold their value, the company can offer surprisingly affordable finance deals on its models.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to say that a Plus Four would be anything like a 718 Boxster or GR Supra to own. Old-world charm is what this car exists to engender. Its design is about as inimitably retro as that of any car on the road.</p>
<p>But under its aluminium bodywork now sits a BMW turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an all-aluminium monocoque chassis, making this the first four-cylinder Morgan in the thick end of a century not to use traditional ladder-frame construction.</p>
<p>With 255bhp on tap, the Plus Four isn’t backwards coming forwards, but it remains a sports car for a particular, slightly laid back stride. It’s a car from which to take in a perfect English summer’s afternoon - with a bit of gusto, but nothing like as much as you might be tempted to with some sports cars.</p>
<p>Narrow and zippy, it makes short work of country lanes, although its cloth hood and half doors make for noisy motorway cruising, and neither its ride nor its limit handling are quite as well resolved as you might expect for your £60,000 sports car budget.</p>
<p>Even with a modern chassis and a modern turbocharged BMW engine, the Plus Four remains evocative to a fault. It’s still wonderful in its leafy, unhurried element.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>10. MG Cyberster</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/best_affordable_sports_cars_-_mg_cyberster.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>zero emissions fun</p>
<p>The MG Cyberster is the only electric option on this list, moulding classic sports car proportions meet modern supercar styling. It&#039;s still the only electric convertible on sale. </p>
<p>Power comes from a 75kWh battery, which is capable of producing over 300 miles of range. Power stands at 335bhp for the rear-motor version, or 503bhp in the dual-motor, all-wheel drive car. </p>
<p>This is a sports car that won&#039;t be for everybody, and despite hitting 0-62mph in as little as 3.4sec, the Cyberster feels a bit odd in some areas. It doesn&#039;t possess the best seating position, for example, and its ADAS systems border on infuriating. </p>
<p>That said, it does offer a unique driving experience. A silent drop-top has more drama to it than you might think, and as a grand tourer, you could do far worse. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/byd_seal_06_dm-i_estate_-_front_three_quarters.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="BYD Seal 06 DM i estate   front three quarters" title="BYD Seal 06 DM i estate   front three quarters" /><figcaption>BYD Seal 06 DM i estate   front three quarters</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>BYD&#039;s UK line-up is set to swell in the coming months with the addition of a new plug-in hybrid saloon and estate to rival the <a href="/car-review/bmw/3-series">BMW 330e</a> and <a href="/car-review/skoda/superb">Skoda Superb</a> iV.</p>
<p>Called the Seal 06 DM-i, the new model will become the seventh <a href="/car-reviews/byd">BYD</a> model on sale in the UK, Autocar understands, joining the <a href="/car-review/byd/atto-3">Atto 3</a>, <a href="/car-review/byd/dolphin">Dolphin</a>, <a href="/car-review/byd/seal">Seal</a>, <a href="/car-review/byd/seal-u">Seal-U</a>, <a href="/car-review/byd/sea-lion-7">Sea Lion 7</a> and the forthcoming <a href="/car-news/new-cars/new-byd-dolphin-surf-bound-uk-sub-£20k-ev">Dolphin Surf</a> supermini.</p>
<p>It is a separate model line to the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/byd-seal-06-gt-revealed-vw-id-3-gtx-rival">BYD 06 GT</a> - which is a battery-electric hatchback in the mould of the <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/id-3">Volkswagen ID 3</a> - also due in the UK soon.</p>
<p>The company has not confirmed a launch date, nor any specifications, but the Seal 06 DM-i was launched in China last year and the UK variant is expected to be little changed.</p>
<p>Its PHEV powertrain combines a 98bhp 1.5-litre petrol engine with either a 10kWh or 16kWh battery for an electric range of either 37 or 56 miles, according to official WLTP figures. Power output is pegged at either 160bhp or 213bhp, and both versions get from 0-62mph in less than 8.0sec. </p>
<p>Each powertrain variant sends all its power to the front wheels through a CVT gearbox. </p>

<p>Both the saloon and estate versions of the Seal 06 measure around 4.8 metres long and 1.5 metres tall, making it a natural rival to the Skoda Superb and BMW 330e, which also offer the choice of bodystyles.</p>
<p>The cockpit is almost identical to that of the Seal, with an 8.8in digital gauge cluster, a 15.6in rotating touchscreen and a selection of physical buttons on the centre console and steering wheel.</p>
<p>There is no indication of price yet, but the mechanically related Seal-U PHEV starts at around £33,000.</p>
<p>BYD is expanding its plug-in hybrid line-up in Europe as part of a drive to boost its market share in the face of wavering EV uptake in the region. </p>
<p>Europe boss Stella Li told Autocar last year that PHEVs have a "very important role" in the company&#039;s growth plans, because they provide a bridge for buyers to move from combustion to electric powertrains.</p>
<p>"A lot of people want to try electric cars, but currently they have range anxiety and hesitate, but this car gives them the solution,” said Li.</p>

<p>If I had all the money, I don’t think I’d buy a new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/g-class">Mercedes-Benz G-Class.</a></p>
<p>It’s a fine car, of course, but I don’t have the gall to mis-space the letters of my gel numberplates, and big alloys and low-profile tyres on serious<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-4x4s-off-road-cars"> 4x4s</a> just look wrong to me.</p>
<p>But hello, here comes the new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mercedes-benz-g-class-harks-back-1980s-ancestor">‘Stronger than the 1980s’ special edition G-Class</a>, which comes in two choice period colours, receives orange indicator repeaters, wears a black grille and light surround and runs on trad-looking 18in five-spoke wheels wearing chunky 265/60 R18 tyres.</p>
<p>What a difference some very small details can make. It has gone from a car that I’d dismiss very easily to one about which I think: ‘Don’t wrap it – I’ll drive it home.’</p>
<p>I’ve just been on the G-Class configurator (an activity plenty of people avoiding deadlines will be familiar with. There’s now a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/morgan/supersport">Morgan Supersport</a> one, by the way), and it’s true that you can already spec classic-style ‘Manufaktur’ non-metallic colours – like sand, a dark green and two blues – on the G-Class.</p>
<p>You can colour the wheel arches and roof in black too. But still those options don’t quite transform the car like these limited-edition details do.</p>
<p>For one, I think the new paint colours are rather more ‘period’ (<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz">Mercedes </a>even calls them ‘nostalgia colours’), but the rest is all about those three changes: repeaters, grille, wheels. Mostly the 18in wheels; the minimum standard wheel size on a new G-Class is otherwise 20in.</p>
<p>Is there another car to which three such small options could make such a grand difference?  I don’t think so. Retro design details on modern cars usually look like anomalies, but here, because the latest G-Class design is sufficiently close to the original anyway, it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>It’s a typically specified modern G-Class, in those satin greys that are so popular, and on the big 22in wheels that <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-amg">AMG models</a> wear, that looks like a restomod – an elderly gentleman dressed in athleisure wear.</p>
<p>Some modifiers and restomodders of original <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/defender">Land Rover Defenders</a> make similar mistakes, fitting weird LED headlight units, modern paint finishes and wheels that look far, far too big. The ‘Stronger than the 1980s’ G-Class is our old gent slipping back into his brogues and tweed. He looks right again.</p>
<p>I feel like we’ve talked around this retro subject before. Many car designers don’t like retro designs, because they’re in the business of making new things, not rehashing old ones.</p>
<p>But the G-Class isn’t a new car and some of the aesthetic options you can put on one feel like that white rendering and grey window framing people seem intent on putting on previously characterful houses.</p>
<p>Fashion aside, I think this new G-Class just looks more authentic, more fit for purpose. If one is going to have a big 4x4, why fit wheels and tyres that don’t suit off-roading and paint it such that you wouldn’t dare take it near a thorn bush?</p>
<p>In the past year, I’ve spent time in a new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/defender-130">Land Rover Defender 130</a> on big, shiny black alloys and with satin black paint and in an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ineos/grenadier">Ineos Grenadier</a> with neither of those things.</p>
<p>The Defender is the better car to drive: it’s calmer, more relaxing, more comfortable, quieter, brilliantly capable off road and tows for Britain. But I felt sufficiently less conspicuous in the Grenadier that, spec for spec, it’s the one I’d have.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve never reached a stage in life where I don’t care what other people think. But cars, particularly those bought for a want and not a need, do say something about their owners, don’t they?</p>
<p>This G-Class looks like it has been specced and built and is owned for the reasons it was first intended. And I’d rather drive that, even if it’s a slightly ‘worse’ car than a regular one, which it might be.</p>
<p>Those tyres will probably give it less directional stability and certainly squidgier steering, and as they’re probably heavier might not even improve the ride. Does that make me shallow? Oh well.</p>
<p>The only part of a ‘modern’ G-Class I think I prefer in fact is the interior grab handle, because of the big ‘Stronger than the 1980s’ script on this special edition.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have that written so close to a stereo that would spend at least 70% of its time playing absolute 1980s bangers.</p>

<figcaption>Morris Minor Leaner Feature 2025   ME 22</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-morris-minor">Morris Minor</a> fan near where I live. He has a Traveller on his drive and a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-compact-saloons">saloon</a> on the road outside that doesn’t appear to have moved for some time because there’s an eco system developing underneath it.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks ago, while cycling past Hampton Court Palace, I saw what looked like the saloon motoring along the A308 in the direction of the M3. An impressive turnaround in fortune for a car that, I suspected, might never run again.</p>
<p>Except this wasn’t that Morris Minor. This one was being driven by a young-looking lad who, from the presence of an L-plate front and back, appeared to be learning to drive in it.</p>
<p>A few days later, I spotted the car parked outside the local doctor’s surgery. Further detective work revealed that the blue 1968 Morris Minor 1000 is the pride and joy of father Ed Wilson and his son Patrick.</p>
<p>Patrick is 17 years old and has been learning to drive over the past four months. First, if you believe the mass media, no youngsters are learning to drive these days, and second, if they are, they’re not likely to be learning in a 57-year-old classic.</p>
<p>I found the sight of young Patrick in his Morris Minor rather heart-warming.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/morris-minor-leaner-feature-2025-me-1.jpg?itok=w3sDeZqQ" width="900" /></p>
<p>So, Ed, why isn’t junior learning to drive in something more modern? Something a bit more conventional like a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/polo-1">Volkswagen Polo</a> or <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/fiesta-2017-2022">Ford Fiesta?</a> “Money,” says Ed. “At least that’s the primary reason.”</p>
<p>I’d heard via word of mouth that insuring young people to drive a classic car was far cheaper than for a modern car. That turned out to be true because Patrick, who is the policy holder on the Minor, with dad as a named driver, pays only £120 per year. </p>
<p>"That’s for limited mileage, and only 1000 miles at that, but that’s adequate for us as we don’t go very far from home,” says Ed. “And although the premium will rise once he’s passed his test, it will still be far cheaper than for a modern car.”</p>
<p>Why a Morris Minor? “Well, my grandfather had one,” says Ed, “which added some appeal. We looked at a Traveller but the woodwork was really rotten so we gave that one a miss. Then we spotted this saloon that was for sale for £1500.</p>
<p>"As you can see, the paintwork is very dull and there is some surface rust in places, but structurally it’s pretty sound. The other advantage of this car is that it’s ULEZ-exempt, which is an important factor when you’re on a tight budget.”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/morris-minor-leaner-feature-2025-me-24.jpg?itok=bySQvqBC" width="900" /></p>
<p>Ed learned to drive at the age of 25 in a Ford Fiesta, a rather more sophisticated car than the Moggie. “It took me a while to adjust to driving the Minor,” he says, “but Patrick picked it up quicker than me.”</p>
<p>Patrick says: “Most of my friends are learning to drive, but nobody is driving a car as old as ours. They haven’t commented much on the Morris but my sister Poppy reckons that it’s a really cool car.”</p>
<p>Even for Ed, the Morris has features he had not encountered before. Such as a foot-operated dip switch. “I’ve never owned a car with a manual choke,” he says, “which has taken some mastering.”</p>
<p>But it’s not what the car has: it’s what it hasn’t that makes it interesting for a learner driver. Like synchromesh on first gear. “I’ve had to learn to think ahead,” says Patrick.</p>
<p>“I only drive the car in town but even so I have to think carefully when I’m coming up to a junction or making a manoeuvre. I don’t think I’d like to drive it on a motorway as it’s not fast enough and other traffic would be intimidating. I’ll be taking my test in a modern car.”</p>
<p>There’s no question in my mind that Patrick will be a better driver for learning in such an analogue car with no distractions.</p>
<p>He’ll be picking up skills that will be of great use to him throughout his driving life even if he does migrate to a modern car that will help steer and park for him, spot pedestrians and carry out emergency stops.</p>
<p>What did I learn in? A Morris Minor 1000 Traveller. </p>

<p>There are few meeting rooms in the British motoring industry that Paul Dickinson hasn’t graced.</p>
<p>A real automotive lifer, he started at the Rover Group as an apprentice in 1997 then moved to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover">Jaguar Land Rover’s</a> finance department when the company was bought by<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw"> BMW.</a></p>
<p>Dickinson would later go on to play a pivotal role in bringing the acclaimed LRX concept to production as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/range-rover-evoque">Range Rover Evoque</a>.</p>
<p>More recently he spent time at <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bentley">Bentley</a>, where he was central to the conception and growth of the Mulliner coachbuilding division, and he was then finance boss at Group <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lotus">Lotus</a> during the period when it was launching its new Chapman Bespoke division.</p>
<p>Wellingborough-based RML Group – a lesser-known and more ‘backstage’ engineering operation, historically rooted in motorsport – may on the face of it seem to be a strange place for him to end up.</p>
<p>Appointed as group CEO in June last year at around the same time as RML was acquired by a US investor, he gives a fairly concise summary of his job description. “My remit,” he says, “is to grow this business.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t just mean Dickinson will lean on his finance experience to swell the company coffers, though; it’s more about branching out into new business areas, claiming a bigger share of its markets and becoming more of a household name.</p>
<p>Historically, motorsport engineering was this outfit’s bread and butter, and RML is best known for its race-based collaborations with the likes of <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/nissan">Nissan </a>and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>, scoring <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/motorsport-news/btcc">British Touring Car Championship</a> titles and<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/motorsport-news/le-mans-and-sportscars"> Le Mans 24 Hours</a> class wins.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/rml-interview-and-tour-2025-me-46.jpg?itok=jnZs8KDe" width="900" /></p>
<p>But today racing accounts for just 10% of RML revenues, and work is well under way to diversify the firm’s output and ensure it’s participating in as many ‘races’ as possible – just not so much on the track these days.</p>
<p>It all starts here with the P39, an untouchably exclusive, carbonfibre-bodied reworking of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/porsche/911-turbo-s">Porsche 911 Turbo S</a>, one that promises to outpace a<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/porsche/911-gt3-rs"> GT3 RS</a> on the track while remaining as usable in the real world as any factory-fresh <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-supercars">supercar.</a></p>
<p>As the second model from RML’s nascent Bespoke division, it is designed with influence from the legendary <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/porsche/911">911 GT1</a>. Its blown flat-six engine has been tickled by Litchfield to produce almost as much power as a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bugatti/veyron-2005-2015">Bugatti Veyron</a>, the bespoke bodywork and active aero generate up to 930kg of downforce and it costs £540,000 plus the cost of your donor car.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/rml/short-wheelbase">Ferrari 250 GTO-inspired Short Wheelbase</a> from a few years back, the P39 has been conceived both as a revenue generator and a technical tour de force that showcases RML’s awesome engineering might, which for so long has been hidden under a bushel by the outfit’s positioning as a white-label engineering and design partner to big-name OEMs.</p>
<p>“The whole point of the Bespoke division,” says Dickinson, “is for us to come out of the shadows and demonstrate in the consumer world: here are our products, here is our engineering quality, here is our skill, here is our attention to detail, here is all of our motorsport heritage – applied to something relevant to you.”</p>
<p>Then the idea is that the commercial success of these Bespoke products will help to grow the core engineering consultancy business. He adds: “Each time we have a successful product, that reflects back on the wider RML brand.”</p>
<p>So these creations must be not only unfathomably capable but also, crucially, achingly desirable – and doubly so in the face of intense competition from the bespoke divisions of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-luxury-cars">luxury car </a>makers themselves. And the key to that, as demonstrated by the monstrous profit figures generated by the likes of <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/rolls-royce">Rolls-Royce</a> Bespoke and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lamborghini">Lamborghini’s</a> Ad Personam, is exclusivity and personalisation.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/rml-interview-and-tour-2025-me-43.jpg?itok=bMEm1O_x" width="900" /></p>
<p>It is here that Dickinson’s experience in resurrecting Bentley’s Mulliner as a coachbuilder for the new age comes into play. “That really helped me understand how the bespoke market works,” he says. “Mulliner is the pinnacle, but it showcases the rest of Bentley’s skills.</p>
<p>"When you brought a customer in to devise their own spec, they realised just how impressive a Bentley is before you even Mulliner-ise it.”</p>
<p>While each of the P39s will be identical in a technical sense, then, down to the bespoke suspension links, driver-adjustable aero, 100mm widened track and 25mm lengthened wheelbase, the rest of the specification is completely at the discretion of the owner.</p>
<p>“Customers really appreciate uniqueness,” says Dickinson. “There are some very wealthy people in the world, but they don’t just spend money for the sake of it. They are very focused on value for money."</p>
<p>Dickinson theorises that the experience is sometimes as important as the end product, which helps to explain why RML has invested so heavily in ensuring that the process of personalising a P39 will be truly special.</p>
<p>When we visit, the customisation suite is still a work in progress, but already it is apparent that this will be a quite agreeable place for the 39 well-heeled owners to spend a few hours.</p>
<p>Cabinets are topped with reams of strokable material swatches and paint sample cards to agonise over, before you have a play with the shift paddles and test out the various options for the door pulls.</p>
<p>There’s also a VR headset on hand so you can walk around a life-size digital version of your car. It allows you to see how different colours and materials change according to lighting, and you can get as comfortable with your spec as possible before pulling the trigger.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/rml-interview-and-tour-2025-me-32.jpg?itok=4e-B6VQx" width="900" /></p>
<p>I’m excited to give it a go but, allowed such dizzying freedom of expression and a hypothetical bottomless pit of money to spend on options, I find myself racked by a paralysing sense of indecision.</p>
<p>Whiling away your lunch break on a configurator can be a relaxing exercise in escapism but, even allowing for the fact that it’s all imaginary, speccing a P39 – with the boss at your side and the production line over your shoulder – feels rather more daunting.</p>
<p>I want to do justice to RML’s lovingly engineered creation and honour its performance potential by not going ‘full Knightsbridge’ with my virtual supercar, but this is a drop-dead silhouette that begs for some lurid adornment.</p>
<p>So Autocar’s P39 is – appropriately – bright yellow. More particularly, it’s a shade that’s inspired by the legendary <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ruf/ctr/first-drives/ruf-ctr-anniversary-2021-first-drive">Ruf CTR ‘Yellowbird’,</a> another 911-based monster that has claimed its fair share of scalps at the Nordschleife.</p>
<p>I don’t want the interior to be so overtly decorated, but playing it safe with black feels like a missed opportunity. So I split the difference with a tasteful tan and choose a suitably technical wheel design that befits the engineering-led approach to the P39’s design.</p>
<p>Were we ordering one of the first 10 cars, our example would have come with a special ‘RML 40th anniversary’ trim package, complete with bespoke badging, embroidery and subtle red detailing – the precise hue of which has been the source of considerable debate among its makers.</p>
<p>Michael Mallock, son of founder Ray Mallock and now head of the Bespoke division, says that, irrespective of the colour and trim chosen, all 39 owners of the P39 can be sure they have bought one of the most capable and technically impressive road cars on the market.</p>
<p>“But the key with this project,” he adds, “and any vehicle that we do with Bespoke – previously and going forward – is that it’s all usable performance.</p>
<p>“The main reason that the P39 has the dynamics it does is that I hate driving performance cars on the road.</p>
<p>"We’ve tried to retain as much of the usability and flexibility that the<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/turbo-ladder-50-years-porsche-911-turbo"> 911 Turbo S </a>has. In Normal mode it will feel quite sensible and not overly stiff, but then you can put it into Track mode and it will be capable of doing a sub-6min 45sec lap around the Nordschleife.”</p>

<p>That duality and ease of use – unusual attributes for such a rapid and hardcore machine – underpinned the project’s conception, says Mallock, which is why such rigid attention was paid to ensuring the substantial increase in performance didn’t come at the expense of ride comfort or composure.</p>
<p>RML claims that in 96.8% of road driving – referred to in hushed tones around the workshop as ‘The Magic 97%’ – the P39 has the same wheel rate as the Turbo S on which it is based.</p>
<p>Does that mean P39 owners will be inclined to use their car on a daily basis rather than rush it into a hermetically sealed private collection? “Go to Sainsbury’s and do the school run?” laughs Mallock. “I would be incredibly surprised, but I would love to see it.”</p>
<p>The P39’s use case as a supermarket shuttle is perhaps not cemented by the fact that the 911’s frunk has made way for a colossal air dam, sealed away behind that one-piece carbonfibre front end, but even so this is clearly not a car that has been engineered exclusively for circuit dominance.</p>
<p>The more P39s that do venture out in public the better, as far as RML is concerned: the expansion of the Bespoke division is all about shouting the company’s name from the rooftops.</p>
<p>The Short Wheelbase, the P39 and whatever follows on from it will play important roles in increasing the company’s visibility, celebrating its engineering prowess and pitching it as real competition to the luxury car market stalwarts.</p>
<p>If that also serves as a chance to give some exposure to the teams engineering these amazing machines, then that’s a handy bonus, says Mallock: “It’s hard to publicise what you do when you can’t talk about it – and it’s also not great for the team that’s delivering it, when they can’t talk about it.”</p>
<p>Imagine playing a pivotal role in creating a knockout supercar capable of absolutely blistering lap times, but it wears another company’s badge and you’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement so you can’t boast about your contribution. Now, with RML selling cars under its own name, you can.</p>
<p>As for what will come next, everyone is keeping schtum – but Dickinson suggests it will slot neatly between the two existing Bespoke cars in positioning terms.</p>
<p>He adds: “We had the Short Wheelbase as our first product, which is in the million-and-a-half-pounds price bracket, and the P39 is in the half-a-million-pound bracket. So there’s probably a space in between where we could find something that fits.”</p>
<p>Whatever it is, though, Dickinson is clear about one thing: “It will always be fun and interesting.” </p>

<p>The new boss of Lotus Europe is seeking to broaden production at the brand&#039;s UK base to include new models from the wider Geely group.</p>
<p><a href="/car-news/features/how-matt-windle-putting-lotus-back-map">Matt Windle</a> has been promoted from his position as Lotus Cars MD following the departure of former <a href="/car-reviews/lotus">Lotus</a> Europe CEO <a href="/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/lotus-delays-electric-crossover-sports-car-focus-hybrids">Dan Balmer</a> after less than a year.</p>
<p>His broader role coincides with the recent <a href="/car-news/business-corporate/lotus-be-single-company-again-after-ownership-change">merging of Lotus Cars with the Chinese-based Lotus Technology</a>, which oversaw the brand&#039;s so-called lifestyle EVs, the <a href="/car-review/lotus/eletre">Eletre</a> SUV and <a href="/car-review/lotus/eletre">Emeya</a> saloon.</p>
<p>“I think it&#039;s better for the business,” Windle told Autocar in an interview. “It gives us a solid link between manufacturing and commercial on sports cars but allows me to work wider across the business as well.”</p>
<p>Windle is keen to grow production at Hethel, which earlier this year announced <a href="/car-news/business-corporate/lotus-axe-270-uk-jobs-amid-volatile-market-conditions">270 job cuts</a> as demand for the <a href="/car-review/lotus/emira">Emira</a> petrol sports car was hit by the sharp increase in tariffs in the US.</p>
<p>“It has been a turbulent start of the year, which has had an impact on the business,” he said.</p>
<p>Lotus last year posted record wholesales (sales to dealers) of the Emira at 5272, up 102%, but Windle is keep to push close to the factory’s limits of 10,000 cars annually. </p>
<p>"Back in the late 1990s and 2000s, we were building several models at Hethel [including the <a href="/car-review/lotus/elise">Elise</a>-based <a href="/car-reviews/vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> VX220 and <a href="/car-review/tesla/roadster">Tesla</a> Roadster], and I think that&#039;s a business model we&#039;re exploring,” he said.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/lotus-emira-4-cylinder-2023-review-01-cornering-front_2_0.jpg?itok=dRNJlpAz" width="900" /></p>
<p>One possibility is the forthcoming <a href="/car-news/new-cars/polestar-6-%E2%80%98daily-driver%E2%80%99-supercar-set-longer-production-run">Polestar 6</a> electric roadster. “I think we could build it,” Windle said. “There&#039;s an element of transition, because at the moment it&#039;s just ICE [at Hethel], but we&#039;re going to have to go on that journey.”</p>
<p>The US&#039;s new car import tariff has hit Lotus hard, with the company cancelling sales of the Chinese-built Emeya and Eletre in the country due to the now-insurmountable financial hurdles.</p>
<p>Lotus has also halted shipments of the British-built Emira to the US after the new 25% tariff was applied in April, meaning that no cars are heading to a market that last year accounted for a fifth of all Lotus sales.</p>
<p>The deal recently agreed between the UK and US to lower those tariffs to 10% has helped Lotus, but Windle has yet to press go on restarting shipments to the US as he waits for the details.</p>
<p>"The headline numbers have gone out there, but actually the specifics behind it still haven&#039;t been clarified,” he said.</p>
<p>“There&#039;s product that&#039;s ready to ship, but what we don&#039;t want to do is jump the gun and end up getting clobbered.</p>
<p>“The tariffs are a negative with where we are now, but they could be a positive."</p>
<p>Lotus’s volume growth has been impressive, given where it has come from, with overall deliveries hitting 12,134 last year, double that of the year before.</p>
<p>However, EV sales are below planned volumes as demand for luxury electric cars has fallen below expectations. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/lotus-emeya-600-2025-front-quarter-tracking.jpg?itok=pMycitcN" width="900" /></p>
<p>Lotus is countering that with planned launch of <a href="/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/lotus-delays-electric-crossover-sports-car-focus-hybrids">‘Hyper Hybrid’ range-extended EVs</a> that feature a turbocharged combustion engine.</p>
<p>The first such model will be unveiled at the end of this year for sales starting in China early next year, CEO Feng Qingfeng said on the company’s earnings call on 22 April. No date has been set for European sales, though, Windle said.</p>
<p>The planned new electric sports car to be built in Hethel, meanwhile, is on hold as Lotus assesses likely demand.</p>
<p>“Is the market ready for an electric sports car? I don&#039;t really know the answer to that yet,” Windle said. </p>
<p>One possibility is to install an electric drivetrain and batteries into the current Emira platform and offer it as a variant, but uncertain customer response is hampering decision-making.</p>
<p>“I think being a product strategy person in the automotive industry is probably one of the most difficult jobs areas at the moment,” Windle said.</p>
<p>His message to the UK and EU governments is to keep options open for consumers past 2035, including possibility allowing a longer life for range-extended EVs.</p>
<p>“A full BEV future is maybe not the answer,” he said.</p>
<p>Windle’s elevation to Lotus Europe boss gives him oversight of sales within Lotus’s biggest global market, which accounted for 39% of the company’s global sales last year, at 4743.</p>
<p>He plans to growth that at first by expanding the dealers.</p>
<p>“Network development is a big part of our strategy is around volume growth going forward,” he said. “I think the opportunity is there and it&#039;s going to be exciting couple of years.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron" /><figcaption>Bugatti Chiron</figcaption></figure><h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>The <strong>Bugatti Chiron</strong> design brief was very straightforward – the simplest that Bugatti&#039;s bosses of the time had encountered. “Be better than the <a href="/car-review/bugatti/veyron-2005-2015">Veyron</a> [its predecessor] in every respect,” it said.</p>
<p>Some numbers about the Chiron, then, if I may. At launch, the official line said the Chiron was able to do 420kph, or 261mph, which was misleading, because that&#039;s both electronically limited and slower than the old Veyron Super Sport when that became the world’s fastest production car, at 267.8mph.</p>
<p>That had a mere 1183bhp to be getting on with. The standard Chiron had 1479bhp, so it ought to have gone rather faster than the Veyron. </p>
<p>Bugatti waited for the Chiron Super Sport 300+ (with 1578bhp) to go after a top speed run, which it set at <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> Group’s Ehra-Lessien test track and achieved 304.7mph.</p>
<p>Bugatti built just 30 such models but other limited-run variants of the Chiron too: we tested an original car and later a Super Sport (the same mechanically as the 300+ but with a more habitable interior and a speed limiter at 273mph).</p>
<p>Whichever variety of Chiron you&#039;re talking, the top speed numbers are important, because everything else you read about the Chiron here has to be tempered by them. It&#039;s a car defined by massive numbers, at once constraining and liberated by its singular top speed, which dominates yet compromises the Chiron&#039;s character. </p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron-rear.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron rear" /></p>
<div>
<p>The Chiron is a carbonfibre-tubbed two-seater with conventionally opening doors. It has an 8.0-litre 16-cylinder engine in a W configuration, which means four banks of four cylinders around a common crankshaft, the upper two banks with a 90deg V between them and the lower two another 15deg each side of those. </p>
<p>There are four turbos, two of which are blowing all the time and fed by eight exhausts apiece, to minimise what would otherwise be unimaginable lag. The other two are valved, to drop in and out depending on throttle position and rev range, and when they’re ‘on’, each of the four turbos is powered by four exhausts. </p>
<p>That they drop in and out helps to make a near-flat torque curve of 1180lb ft from 2000pm to 6000rpm on the standard Chiron – a number that seemed no smaller no matter how many times I wrote it. The Super Sport makes the same output, but it starts at 2200rpm and keeps it until 7000rpm, at which point it&#039;s making its 1578bhp.</p>
<p>The power travels to all four wheels via a revised version of the Veyron’s Ricardo-designed dual-clutch automatic transmission that uses heavier-duty clutches and lighter gears. Power goes mostly to the rear, but with a Haldex coupling pushing it to the front when the rears can’t cope – which would be often.</p>
<p>Wheel sizes, up by an inch each end over the Veyron&#039;s, are 20in fronts and 21s at the rear, but tyres are wider at the front (285mm) and narrower at the back (355mm) than on a Veyron Super Sport, for a better handling balance. By Bugatti&#039;s calculations, it would be among the fastest cars in the world around Le Mans, thanks largely to its performance along the Mulsanne Straight. </p>
<p>Being a Volkswagen Group car, the Chiron must work all over the world, and 1479bhp and 1180lb ft wants an astonishing amount of cooling, so although the Chiron is low, at 1212mm, it&#039;s 2038mm wide. </p>
<p>To be more slippery and stable at really high speeds the Super Sport is 250mm longer of body, with exhausts that sit atop each other at the body edge rather than side by side in the middle of the car, so that the lower diffuser could be bigger and extend towards the upper bodywork.</p>
<p>Other notable details on the Chiron? Literally hours of them. Turbos that look about 50% bigger than the Veyron’s, a carbonfibre intake manifold, conrods that can take half as much more strain as a Veyron’s but weigh no more, 420mm diameter carbon-ceramic brake discs, a steering wheel milled from a solid piece of aluminium, suspension bushes that contain three different rubber compounds to give different responses laterally, longitudinally and vertically, and the CFRP underbody, flat apart from Naca ducts, a few strakes by the front wheels and a deeper diffuser and constructed from a honeycomb-cored composite that, in thinner form and with a smarter finish, comprises the car’s body – a body whose weave is so exquisitely constructed that you can leave it bare if you like, or colour it mildly through the clearcoat.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron-interior.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron interior" /></p>
<div>
<p>Among the materials <span>inside the Chiron</span> there is leather, obviously, and metal, obviously, and not a lot else.</p>
<p>It feels beautifully assembled because it will be, but the leather covering is firm, not soft, because you’re aware that with weight to save (it has 270mph-plus to do), adding tens of kilos of insulation is a premium one cannot afford.</p>
<p>But there are reminders that this is a £2.5m-plus car. Stitching is lovely and the gaps between materials are nanometre perfect. The world’s longest automotive lighting bar, it says here, swoops around behind you, enhancing a feeling of separation between driver and passenger while splitting the view rearwards in two.</p>
<p>The seats are supportive, not broad, and electrically adjusted, but the cabin feels wide. The steering wheel gets manual adjustment, a start button, a drive mode selector and shift paddles. The handbrake is electronic, the centre console is ultra-slim (hence the swoopy bar, to add perceived width and strength down the car’s centre) and covered in a piece of beautifully machined and satin-polished metal, adorned with knobs that turn with the oiliness of those on a top-end hi-fi.</p>
<p>Visibility is pretty average but ergonomics are otherwise straight out of the Volkswagen Group handbook. So you thumb the starter like you might in an Audi and the engine fires to a voluble but, from a cylinder-count perspective, indistinct cacophony, and it&#039;s ready. Everything is where you expect it to be. You could be in a <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf">Volkswagen Golf</a> – a 1479bhp, 8.0-litre, two-metre-wide Golf that can do 275mph or thereabouts, but a Golf nonetheless. I mean that in a flattering way. It’s a remarkable achievement.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron-front-quarter.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron front quarter" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>We&#039;ve driven both a standard Chiron and a later Super Sport, both on the road only, so there are only so many things we can tell you about the performance, but our first go was in a place where - how to say this? - we could take a certain number of liberties with its speed.</p>
<p>How fast is the standard Chiron? Very, obviously, but so are lots of cars. It&#039;s the way the Chiron is fast that&#039;s remarkable.</p>
<p>It’s not fast in a <a href="/car-review/porsche/taycan">Porsche Taycan Turbo S</a> way: the Porsche is immediate, getting up and going before the Veyron has decided which of its turbos to send air through. Nor is it <a href="/car-review/ariel/atom/first-drives/ariel-atom-v8">Ariel Atom V8</a> fast, which is hairy and immediate like a superbike. It’s not even <a href="/car-review/mclaren/p1-2014-2015">McLaren P1</a> kind of fast. The P1 has a torque dip-filling electric motor to get it going and, relatively speaking, a race-style engine, two-wheel drive and much less weight. </p>
<p>No, the Chiron has a far more literal interpretation of acceleration than any of these. There’s lag – quite a lot of it usually – while it inhales massively and, about a second after you ask it to, begins to push you along the road, in loping, increasingly urgent strides of noise and blur. </p>
<p>The noise that accompanies that is overwhelming – like standing next to an express train or hovercraft as it leaves a station or waterside. It&#039;s not soulful, per se, but is clearly expensive, multi-cylindered, airy, fully lit, fully impressive. The Chiron spools and rushes and keeps rushing, with exceptional stability even as it passes 200mph, which it reaches incredibly quickly. </p>
<p>At 300mph, so Bugatti&#039;s test driver Andy Wallace tells us, things get rather more hairy. Not because of aerodynamic stability but because the wheels become gyroscopes like spinning tops, and so Wallace was correcting steering corrections he had made only a few moments ago, because the wheels want to take on a path of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Bugatti’s test drivers tell me that even the standard car is still accelerating appreciably when it hits its 261mph limiter. I lifted off when I was disinclined to see the speedo needle raise further, at which point the Chiron whistled and exhaled a volume of air like the tube had blown off a bouncy castle. And at which point I exhaled too. </p>
<p>The accelerative numbers are astonishing regardless of model: 0-62mph in 2.5sec, 0-124mph in 6.5sec, 0-186mph in 13.6sec on the standard car; or 0-62mph in 2.4sec, 0-124mph in 5.8sec, 0-186mph in 12.1sec and 0-249mph in 28.6sec in the Super Sport.</p>
<p>Cooling is so good that the Super Sport could maintain its 273mph limited top speed, if you could find the right place to do it, until its fuel tank ran dry - which would take eight minutes. </p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron-cornering.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron cornering" /></p>
<div>
<p>The ride is reasonable on the road where the handling is fairly unapproachable. There are drive modes: you can swap between EB mode (the standard one), Highway and Handling modes. EB mode adjusts the adaptive dampers’ stiffness automatically, while the other two stiffen their parameters and reduce ride height. But regardless of the mode, body control is always good and the ride always firm yet rarely crashy. </p>
<p>In EB, the standard Chiron will even ride Belgian pavé well, but the key benefit, other than it being less likely to ground out, is that this mode enhances comfort. In terms of that, then, and body control, it’s good, but closer to a <a href="/car-review/porsche/911-gt3">Porsche 911 GT3</a>’s level of jarring than a <a href="/car-news/new-cars/road-test-rewind-ferrari-488-gtb">Ferrari 488 GTB</a>’s curious plushness. </p>
<p>Steering weight is good, if unnecessarily heavy in Handling mode, and the self-centering is just right. Solidity around the straight-ahead is reassuring (as you would hope), the lock is mediocre and the directness and feel (or the electrically assisted approximation of it) is decent and about as good as it is in, say, a <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf-r">Golf R</a> (in case you’re thinking of trading up).</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron" /></p>
<div>
<p>It was explained to us at the launch of the Chiron by Wolfgang Dürheimer, who was then the CEO of both Bugatti and Bentley, the difference between buyers from the two brands.</p>
<p>A Bentley owner might invite friends to the hospitality box they keep at a football match or to stay at a hotel afterwards where they have a suite. A Bugatti owner would invite their friends to the football club they own and then to one of their own hotels.</p>
<p>A standard Chiron was around £2.5m new. The Super Sport was £2.75m. Many buyers own more than one.</p>
<p>It has been said that if you couldn&#039;t afford to run a supercar or expensive sports car when it was new, then you probably can&#039;t afford to run one later either, because running costs don&#039;t depreciate like the purchase price does. I think the same is true of a Chiron, only by a much, much higher factor. </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bugatti-chiron-rear-quarter.jpg" width="900" height="596" alt="Bugatti Chiron rear quarter" /></p>
<div>
<p>It would have been (relatively) easy for Bugatti to have given the Chiron a vast engine and top speed and to have considered that a job done, but that would have been no harder than tuning a <a href="/car-review/nissan/gt-r">Nissan GT-R</a> to 2000bhp. </p>
<p>The Chiron is much, much more than that. When we road tested the Veyron Super Sport for Autocar&#039;s 5000th road test, people with limited familiarity with the car arrived at our test runway, climbed in, drove at 200mph, drove back to the start and climbed out again. Easy. </p>
<p>The Chiron would do all of that but with an extra 50mph, extra luxury, comfort and handling on top. Its crowning triumph is that makes it makes the utterly remarkable seem almost ordinary.</p>
<p>It&#039;s as easy to drive as a Golf, and yet if its speed limiter were removed, it would reach speeds approaching - or over, in the Super Sport&#039;s case - 300mph. The fact that one car is capable of being both of those things is unparalleled in automotive history.</p>

  New Pop trim loses roof rails and swaps alloy wheels for trimmed steel wheels...</blockquote>
<figcaption>panda pop</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>The <a href="/car-review/fiat/grande-panda-electric">Fiat Grande Panda</a> range has been expanded with a new trim level for the Hybrid model, cutting its starting price to £18,035.</p>
<p>Named Pop, it has been made £1000 cheaper than the previous entry level, Icon, with the removal of its alloy wheels, roof rails, privacy glass and the central armrest inside the car. It instead rides on 16in steel wheels with plastic covers.</p>
<p>Pop retains the 10.25in infotainment touchscreen, LED lights and rear parking sensors found on higher trim levels, however.</p>
<p>The Grande Panda Hybrid is powered by a turbocharged 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine and a 28bhp electric motor, the latter of which can drive the car alone for short distances at speeds below 18mph.</p>
<p>The engine and motor combine to put out up to 108bhp, which is sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic gearbox. </p>
<p>The presence of the motor also allows the Grande Panda Hybrid to start up silently, using electric power alone. Similarly, it only uses the motor for low-speed manoeuvres in first or reverse gear, at low speeds.</p>
<p>As well as a lower price, the Pop version of the Grande Panda Hybrid emits less CO2 than the Icon, presumably because its weight is reduced by the removal of extra kit. It&#039;s officially rated at 113g/km, compared with the Icon’s 115g/km.</p>
<p>The Grande Panda Hybrid will enter UK showrooms in the coming months as a rival for the closely related new <a href="/car-review/citroen/c3">Citroën C3</a>, the <a href="/car-review/dacia/sandero">Dacia Sandero</a> and the <a href="/car-review/renault/clio">Renault Clio</a>.</p>
<p>The Grande Panda will also be available as an electric car, pairing a 111bhp front-mounted motor with a 44kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery for a range of 199 miles.</p>
<p>The EV can be recharged at up to 100kW on a DC connection, and the front grille conceals a retractable cable for AC charging at up to 7kW.</p>
<p>It&#039;s priced from £21,035.</p>

<p>Two firefighters and a member of the public have died after a large fire broke out at <a href="/car-news/features/bicester-motion-touring-radical-new-home-british-motoring">Bicester Motion</a> - an ex-RAF base in Oxfordshire that hosts more than 50 automotive businesses.</p>
<p>The blaze erupted in the evening of 15 May, and members of the public reported that the smoke was visible from several miles away, as 10 fire crews were dispatched to the scene.</p>
<p>Oxfordshire County Council has confirmed that two firefighters were killed as they attacked the inferno, while another two have been hospitalised with serious injuries.</p>
<p>The BBC quoted chief fire officer Rob MacDougall as saying: "It is with a very heavy heart that we today report the loss of two of our firefighters. Families have been informed and are being supported."</p>
<p>Details of the member of public killed in the incident have not yet been given.</p>
<p>It isn&#039;t yet known what caused the fire, nor which businesses were based in the buildings that were consumed.</p>
<p>Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has reacted to the incident on X: "Devastating news. My thoughts are with their families and friends. The bravery of our firefighters is astounding. Hoping those in hospital make a full and swift recovery."</p>
<p>Bicester Motion – previously known as <a href="/car-news/consumer/bicester-heritage-scramble">Bicester Heritage</a> - is home to a number of classic car restoration businesses and engineering firms, while Polestar and Morgan also have showrooms in the old airfield complex.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bicester-heritage-grounds.jpg?itok=qKFUgbxN" width="900" /></p>
<p>In a statement issued this morning, Bicester Motion said: "We are deeply saddened to share the tragic news that two firefighters and a close friend of the site have lost their lives. </p>
<p>"There are no words at times like this, but our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones.</p>
<p>"We pray for the two firefighters in hospital. The bravery shown by the emergency services teams has been overwhelming. We are grateful for all the support and especially the exceptional work by all in such unprecedented circumstances.</p>
<p>"The strength and kindness of the Bicester community, of which we are proud members, has truly shown itself.</p>
<p>"The site will remain closed over the weekend as we continue to work closely with the emergency services. Thank you for your understanding at this time."</p>

<p>Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume has issued a frank warning to shareholders that the company must take urgent steps to become more cost-efficient and agile.</p>
<p>Speaking at the company’s AGM in Wolfsburg, Blume acknowledged early progress in the company’s restructuring strategy but stressed that inefficiencies continue to hamper its financial performance.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2025, the <a href="/car-reviews/volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> Group reported an operating profit of €2.9 billion (£2.5bn), a significant decline from the €4.6bn (£3.9bn) achieved in the same period of 2024. This represents a year-on-year decrease of approximately 37%.</p>
<p>The drop in profitability was attributed to so-called special effects totalling €1.1bn (£0.9bn), including costs related to EU CO₂ regulation payments, restructuring measures at the Cariad software division and adjustments linked to import duties introduced in the US. </p>
<p>The operating margin also declined, falling from 6% in the first quarter of 2024 to 3.7% in the same period of 2025.</p>
<p>Despite this, the group&#039;s sales revenue rose by 2.8%, from €75.5bn (£63.6bn) in Q1 2024 to €77.6bn (£66.6bn) in Q1 2025.</p>
<p>In his speech, Blume laid bare the scope of the challenge: “We must address all cost categories – from development and materials to production and fixed overheads.” </p>
<p>His message aligns with recent decisions by Volkswagen Group brands to pause or revise several electric vehicle programmes in favour of combustion-engined models due to rising development costs and below-forecast demand.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, Blume pointed to the group&#039;s ability to scale technology across its various brands as a key strength. “We don’t just develop technology - we scale it,” he said. “Software, battery systems, vehicle platforms – that’s our strategic strength.”</p>
<p>Performance varies across the Volkswagen Group’s portfolio. <a href="/car-reviews/audi">Audi</a> has shown signs of recovery in Europe with the rollout of the <a href="/car-review/audi/q6/e-tron">Q6 E-tron</a>, although profitability remains thin. </p>
<p><a href="/car-reviews/skoda">Skoda</a> and <a href="/car-reviews/cupra">Cupra</a> continue to post sales growth, with Cupra in particular becoming a key revenue driver - and Volkswagen’s passenger car division continues to dominate European sales charts, but price cuts on key models have dented margins. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, delays in launching the <a href="/car-review/porsche/macan-electric">electric Macan</a> have affected <a href="/car-reviews/porsche">Porsche</a>’s first-quarter sales earnings.</p>
<p>One bright spot is the Volkswagen Group’s EV sales. Deliveries almost doubled in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, and the group’s EV market share rose to 26%. Seven of the 10 best-selling EVs in Germany now come from Volkswagen Group brands.</p>
<p>Even so, Blume was cautious about over-interpreting that success. “We have to scale intelligently, not blindly,” he said. “Growth must be profitable.”</p>
<p>Despite the success in EV sales, Volkswagen’s overall financial outlook remains mixed. The group’s share price continues to disappoint shareholders and board members alike. Although 2025 has seen a modest improvement, Blume acknowledged that “our ambition is clearly higher”.</p>

<div>
<p>Our testing of the new-generation <a href="/car-review/audi/q5">Audi Q5</a> has highlighted a slip in class standards for the mid-sized SUV.</p>
<p>That the best-in-class model scores no higher than three-and-a-half stars says plenty about progress being made, or rather not being made, by the breed, the bread-and-butter Q5 itself notable only really for being new rather than any kind of leap forward.</p>
<p>In that context, it’s hard to get too excited by the <strong>Audi SQ5</strong> performance version, the type of go-faster car that can typically push a middling breed in a direction that simply compromises it further.</p>
<p>Which admittedly is unlikely to make you too excited about the words to come on this page. Yet your eyes will probably already have already caught site of the rating at the top of the page: yep, four stars, and the SQ5 reveals itself to have plenty more sparkle about it than its donor car.</p>
<p>It would be a reach to say this ties up with Audi Sport returning to form, but this SQ5 is certainly good and much more of an S car than Audi’s latest <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric cars</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/car-review/audi">Audi</a>&#039;s electric S variants have been a touch meh – more of a trim level with a few nice bits, rather than the toned-down RS experience that we had all come to enjoy. Sure, the S6 E-tron is quicker than the regular <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a6-e-tron">Audi A6 E-tron</a>, but with an EV, that&#039;s a bit &#039;so what?&#039;. Plus it has a notably shorter range.</p>
<p>By contrast, the SQ5 is notably different to the regular Q5 and better than it as well in almost every area when you view it through the right lens. If you’re looking for a razor-sharp handling tool that can cheat physics to lap like a sports saloon around the Nurburging, you will remain disappointed. If you’re instead after an all-weather, all-scenario machine that seems to have been developed for you to enjoy everyday drives in a practical and comfortable package, read on.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-009.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="audi sq5 009" title="audi sq5 009" /></p>
<div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the SQ5 isn&#039;t a major departure from the Q5 on which it&#039;s based and it&#039;s at the subtle end of a sporty makeover. The more outrageous modifications are saved for Audi&#039;s RS models.</p>
<p>The new SQ5 largely follows the latest Audi design language. The front features Audi’s ‘Singleframe’ grille and thin lights, while the shoulder-line is typical <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-family-suvs">family SUV</a>.</p>
<p>As standard, all SQ5s get 21in wheels, S badges, red brake calipers and matrix LED headlights. Quad exhaust pipes are another telltale. </p>
<p>There are some Q-car vibes in how subtle the transition this car has undergone from Q5 to SQ5 has been, but it looks good – sporty but not aggressively so. There&#039;s a classiness and civility to the car still, yet with real purpose.</p>
<p>There’s a Sportback model too. This slope-roofed variant was first introduced in 2021 and in continental Europe it actually outsells the regular <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-suvs">SUV</a>. Not among us Brits, though. Must be something to do with less space for more money thing going on. </p>
<p>Admittedly the difference in boot space here between the SUV (520 litres rising to 1473 litres with the seats flat) and Sportback is barely worth mentioning. Basically, if you like the looks, go for it. </p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-007.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="audi sq5 007" title="audi sq5 007" /></p>
<div>
<p>The interior is very much like the<a href="/car-review/audi/q6-e-tron"> Audi Q6 E-tron</a>. Up front, there’s a 11.9in Virtual Cockpit (the screen behind the steering wheel) and a 14.5in display (the screen in the middle), while the SQ5 also gets Audi’s Passenger Display (the screen on the passenger side) as standard. </p>
<p>They’re slick enough to control, with the driver display screen is the most complicated to use with perhaps too many control and display options for its own good when using the steering wheel control buttons. The passenger side screen can be used to alter the nav or radio in real-time, helping the driver, or to watch videos on. The latter of which can’t be seen from the driver’s point of view. No TikTok while behind the wheel, then, thankfully.</p>
<p>The SQ5 has very few physical buttons. The climate controls are on the big central screen. It gets its own dedicated bar at the bottom, is shown permanently and responds quickly, but it’s still not ideal. Perhaps there&#039;s a way to configure it that we never worked out, but to have to go into the menu to adjust the fan speed was frustrating. Yes, you can always leave it on auto, but that function wasn&#039;t developed with changeable British weather in mind. At least they’re not haptic like in Audis of old, so you don’t need to press it down hard like you’re trying to delete an app on your phone.</p>
<p>Material quality seems fine - just fine. To our eyes and hands, the tiny little drive selector nicked from a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/enyaq-iv">Skoda Enyaq</a> that you pull back or push forward feels cheap and a bit apologetic. The nicest trim comes from the Dinamica microfibre that&#039;s dotted around the interior. This feels modern and sporty, and may as well be Alcantara for how it looks and feels. </p>
<p>The gear paddles are tiny and plastic. They would feel just about okay for a Skoda, but they’re not befitting of a £50,000 Audi and they’re nowhere near the quality we would expect for a £75,000 Audi.</p>
<p>Pull your hand away from the paddles and you will find another peculiarity in the interior: a control panel where you might expect to find the window switches. Those switches are there too but accompanied by quite a few other buttons. Those for the foglights, for instance. This isn’t so bad in isolation, but if you don’t tend to close car doors using their handles, you will end up turning the fogs on – as I and several other testers did.</p>
<p>The window switches also have a strange logic we could never work out, sometimes sending the windows up or down the opposite way to what you would expect.</p>
<p>The sports seats, trimmed in fine nappa leather with diamond stitching, are a real high point of the interior. They feel great: supportive and comfortable. Long distances cause no issue, and the seats are also heated, ventilated and massaging.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-004.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="audi sq5 004" title="audi sq5 004" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>The previous-generation SQ5 was supplied by the black pump, but Audi has seen fit to change it to a 3.0-litre petrol V6 – a 362bhp affair with 406lb ft of torque. </p>
<p>It’s a great unit, pliable with a wide band of operation and a real turn of pace. Such performance was ever thus with modern fast Audis, which have never really fallen short here, it’s the chassis that have been lacking.</p>
<p>The torque levels mean that if you want to treat it like a diesel, you can. Lots of low-down pull makes it easy to drive and to drive quickly without using too many revs. It can spin past 7000rpm but peak torque is achieved below 4000rpm.</p>
<p>Its journey to these numbers is linear and non-fussy. It’s not theatrical like <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alfa-romeo">Alfa Romeo</a>’s V6 or quite as lovely or as offbeat as Audi’s own five-cylinder engine, but it has its own personality. </p>
<p>And when Dynamic mode is selected, there’s even a bit of drama with a few exhaust crackles. Sure, it’s as digitally augmented as a Black Eyed Peas song, but it’s subtle enough for it to not be too cloying.</p>
<p>When left to its own devices, the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox is pretty handy. When the drive mode selector is switched to Dynamic, it changes down quickly and with gusto; in Comfort, it’s less keen to swap cogs. </p>
<p>Things begin to fall down when you change gears yourself. Pull the left shifter in Dynamic when approaching a corner and you feel the whole car jump forward ever so slightly. It’s a BMW-esque thump in the back that’s supposed to say ‘hey, you’re driving a performance car’, but it can be jarring.</p>
<p>It has a bit of mild-hybrid tech: a 24bhp electric motor on the automatic gearbox and a 1.7kWh battery, which allows for some electric-only running. </p>
<p>The integration works fine when you’re going but causes a problem when you’re stopping: there’s a bit of a pedal push needed to get onto the disc and the force needed isn’t always the same. The problem isn’t insurmountable, just slightly irritating. Not being 100% sure on how hard to press the brake pedal isn’t great in a car that’s as large and as powerful as this.</p>
<p>You do however yourself driving on electric power more often than you&#039;d expect, particularly creeping around town or in stop-start traffic. It gives the air of a sporty car that isn&#039;t &#039;always on&#039;, so you can relax and blend in into a drive without having the car egg you on the whole time. The power is there if you want it, but there isn&#039;t a raucousness to it in the background. </p>
<p>The deal breaker to how it performs comes from left field: the lane-keeping assist function which defaults to ‘on’ every time. It is terrible. Shockingly so. It simply does not work on UK roads, failing to read the correct lane markings and erroneously intervening. That it can easily turned off doesn&#039;t excuse it being so bad in the first place.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-008.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="audi sq5 008" title="audi sq5 008" /></p>
<div>
<p>The best way of describing the SQ5 is like a super-sized <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti">Volkswagen Golf GTI.</a> The SQ5 has a well-judged real-world ride and handling balance, backed up by a fast Audi-typical turn of pace, and all while able to remain civilised, refined and comfortable for when you want the miles just to tick by.</p>
<p>Even if it is quite uninspiring, the standard Q5 is still a decent starting point, as a “pleasant and competitive” three-and-a-half star car without any obvious weakness as our road test put it. The Audi Sport engineers have taken that base and made a real unexpected gem.</p>
<p>Why is it unexpected? Because as the Audi range has increased in size, so too has the amount of S and RS models it offers. The range is so broad, so diverse, that it can be hard to know where the centre of the brand sits, and what a fast Audi really is these days. The numbers always tantalise on paper yet the cars have a habit of falling short on the road.</p>
<p>Key to the SQ5’s transformation is its standard adaptive air suspension. This has enabled the SQ5 to not only ride better than we’ve come to expect S-badged Audis but also improve road holding and agility at the same time.</p>
<p>It hasn&#039;t suddenly turned into a <a href="/car-review/porsche/macan-2014-2018">Mk1 Porsche Macan</a> in hitting handling heights – a level that no other mid-size SUV maker, Porsche included, has got near – yet it does everything dynamically to a very good standard, and it has been holistically created in a way where you know what Audi’s engineers were trying to do creating it.</p>
<p>Time to return to that GTI analogy: the SQ5 has got character, which manifests itself in its breadth of ability. Like the hot Golf, it will merely entertain rather than excite you on the twistiest B-road, but you will enjoy the 95% of the other miles you do that day more in the process.</p>
<p>The steering is a touch light but feedback is strong. Dynamic mode adds a bit of heft and a bit of feel too. Its surefootedness means you have to go a bit Asbo to have much fun driving it, but fun is possible.</p>
<p>The square steering ‘wheel’ is easy to use on a set of flowing bends, but it&#039;s difficult to use on roundabouts, as it almost forces you to not shuffle the wheel at all, which really isn’t ideal.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-001.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="audi sq5 001" title="audi sq5 001" /></p>
<div>
<p>The SQ5 is expensive to the point that it will always remain a niche choice: it&#039;s a £75,000 car. Yet modern cars are pricey, mind; if you go hunting for a similarly conceived sports estate for a point of comparison to the SQ5 and a BMW M340i Touring, the range-topper of the <a href="/car-review/bmw/3-series-touring">BMW 3 Series Touring </a>range, is nearly £65,000.</p>
<p>Standard equipment is very strong at least; there&#039;s little you will want for. On the outside, that includes those 21in alloys, matrix LED headlights, digital OLED rear lights, panoramic sunroof and all the S styling.</p>
<p>On the inside, it includes those excellent sports seats, heated rear seats, the interior screens, and heated and automatic everything else seemingly. It&#039;s hard to find what it doesn&#039;t offer. Sadly, the active lane keeping assistance function is one thing thrown in for free.</p>
<p>You don&#039;t buy a car like this for fuel economy, yet on our testing it returned a respectable 32mpg on mixed roads and more than 600 miles of testing. A tank will give a range of more than 400 miles. </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-sq5-006.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="audi sq5 006" title="audi sq5 006" /></p>
<div>
<p>The SQ5 is one of the most complete fast Audis this decade. It’s clearly conceived and is full of agreeable improvements over the standard Q5.</p>
<p>The engine is excellent but the real star of the show is the air suspension, which makes for a really comfortable ride but also a sporty and engaging one. The car is better to drive than we were expecting and is a brilliant match for UK roads.</p>
<p>It isn&#039;t perfect. It could be sharper still to drive, yet that would come at the expense of some everyday usability. The interior should have greater individuality to that and feel more special for the money, yet it does have some standout features of its own, chiefly the sports seats. And the less said about the lane keeping assistance system the better. </p>
<p>The mid-size SUV class has a new champion and perhaps its best all-round package; who&#039;d have thought it would be a 362bhp V6?</p>

<div>
<p>One can make a case that it’s vans such as the <strong>Mercedes-Benz V-Class</strong> and not the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-suvs">SUVs</a> we’re plied with that today come closest to mastering the art of the lifestyle vehicle. </p>
<p>It’s why you find so many <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-mpv-people-carriers">MPV</a> owners waxing lyrical about the utility and surprising opulence of their boxy (and sometimes quite expensive) wheels.</p>
<p>Playing into this is the fact that the ‘van with windows’ market has recently become more desirable and competitive than ever.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has its understatedly charming <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/multivan">Multivan</a>; Ford’s Tourneo Custom has a panoramic roof; and the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lexus/lm">Lexus LM</a>, with its Mark Levinson sound system, is pitched as something to go up against the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/7-series">BMW 7 Series</a>.</p>
<p>As an established player in this area (one in which its compatriots <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi">Audi</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw">BMW</a> still have never so much as dabbled), <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> needs to keep up, and so it has updated the V-Class, with a sharper exterior design and an overhaul of the infotainment system.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-profile-0081.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review profile 0081" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review profile 0081" /></p>
<div>
<p>That said, in the metal it can be tricky to tell the new model apart from the old one, despite the fact that the wider grille, the neater headlights and some gills at the flanks of the front bumper that wouldn’t look entirely out of place on an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-amg/gt">AMG GT</a> are all in fact new.</p>
<p>As for wheelbase, the regular Long model still puts 3200mm of metal between the axles, while the Extra Long stretches to 3430mm – about a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/fiat/500">Fiat 500</a>’s worth. The latter can also be had with an eight-seat configuration – one more than standard. There&#039;s also the Marco Polo version, which is essentially trying to break Volkswagen&#039;s monopoly on the posh camper van market. </p>
<p>In terms of the rear-wheel-drive chassis, the V-Class has offered air suspension as an option since its last meaningful update in 2020, which was also when it adopted the OM654 2.0-litre turbo diesel engine. This is now available in two tunes for the UK: 161bhp and 233bhp, which are badged V220d and V300d. </p>
<p>In the UK, there&#039;s no petrol-engined option, meaning those who want better powertrain refinement than the diesel engine are limited to the electric <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqv">Mercedes EQV</a>. </p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-dash-0033.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review dash 0033" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review dash 0033" /></p>
<div>
<p>The cabin update marks major change. Were it not for the cliff-face geometry of the wide, wood-effect (or, in higher trims, metal-effect) dashboard and the expanse between the front seats (nicely sculpted and with useful armrests), you could almost be forgiven for thinking you had climbed aboard one of Mercedes’ saloons.</p>
<p>Gone are dramatically hooded instrument binnacles and the slightly awkward central touchscreen display, on its plinth. It’s all been replaced with the new generation of MBUX displays (<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto">Android Auto</a> compatability come as standard), although the little ledge that houses a touchpad controller is carried over.</p>
<p>In the main, and given the V-Class&#039;s van DNA, it feels supremely premium in here – something that&#039;s enhanced at night time, when the new ambient lighting comes to the fore.</p>
<p>That said, it can&#039;t totally shake if its commercial roots: the high-set driving position gives a great view of the road but the steering wheel is still set at a bus-like angle.</p>
<p>Of course, the front portion of the cabin is not what the V-Class is really about. That would be the passenger region, which is outstandingly spacious in terms of leg and head room, even with the eight-seat configuration (two rows of three in the back).</p>
<p>Luggage space isn&#039;t quite as straightforward: there&#039;s plenty of it, but only if you opt for the longer bodyshells that Mercedes offers. </p>
<p>The seats themselves are mounted onto rails that run the length of the floor, so you can tinker with the precise amount of leg room each row has. Of course, it&#039;s also possible to have one row facing backwards, although you can also do this in the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/multivan">Multivan</a>.</p>
<p>Whichever inlay trim you opt for also extends down the flanks on the cabin and into the third row, so there&#039;s a premium atmosphere throughout. Opting for beige leather raises the premium appeal of the V-Class still further, and there are other options such as a Burmester sound system and a panoramic roof, which are included for Exclusive trim.</p>
<p>Our extra-long-wheelbase test car was fitted with the Luxury Seat Package, yours for an eye-watering £10,000. Essentially this ditches the standard seven-seat layout for six even more sumptuous individual chairs. </p>
<p>The two seats in the middle row are further enhanced by the addition of heating and ventilation, a massage function, USB charging ports and smartphone stowage. They also get a powered reclining function complete with extendable footrest, which in combination with that extra wheelbase means few cars offer so much room to stretch out.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-front-tracking-0005.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front tracking 0005" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front tracking 0005" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>Barring the occasionally jerky low-speed shift, the diesel-with-torque-converter-gearbox is an effective powertrain for the V-Class, not least because the engine is so torque-rich. Pulling off motorway slip roads, even with many passengers aboard, ought to be no problem for the upper V300d variant we tested.</p>
<p>However, this engine’s gruff tone under load isn’t particularly VIP, somewhat undermining the luxurious atmosphere that Mercedes is striving for here.</p>
<p>At least there’s impressively little wind noise on the move. </p>
<p><span>Perhaps even more impressive is the fact the solidly constructed Merc’s fixtures and fittings are free of the noisy shake, rattle and roll that can often afflict van-based people movers. </span></p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-front-corner-0015.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front corner 0015" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front corner 0015" /></p>
<div>
<p><span>Given its vast external dimensions the rear-wheel-drive V300d handles accurately and clings on gamely. Your many occupants will complain about being thrown about long before the Merc loses its composure. </span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, an impressively tight turning circle endows the V-Class with almost black cab levels of urban dexterity, making it far less stressful in nip-and-tuck urban assaults than you would expect.</span></p>
<p><span>UK cars go without the air suspension available in other markets, yet the standard the coil sprung set-up delivers a fairly settled ride, although sharp imperfections can cause small scale shock waves.</span></p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-front-tracking-0001.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front tracking 0001" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front tracking 0001" /></p>
<div>
<p>The V-Class range starts at just over £76,000 for the seven-seat V220d Long, which uses the same diesel engine as the V300d but detuned from 233bhp to 161bhp.</p>
<p>Having the more powerful – and torquey – engine will cost you around £5000 more, and to us it&#039;s worth the extra outlay.</p>
<p>You might also consider the V-Class in Extra Long form, which precludes you from having a panoramic roof but does create usefully more space for either passenger leg room or luggage. A V300d in Extra Long from starts at a whisker under £83,000.</p>
<p>Whichever version you choose, opting for an eight-seat layout (as opposed to seven seats) is a no-cost option. </p>
<p>All models are also well equipped, although for an extra £13,000, Exclusive trim does bring some choice additions over entry-level Premium. These include the Burmester sound system, a panoramic roof (in Long form), the useful digital rear-view camera and some aesthetic enhancement that make the V-Class even more red-carpet-ready. </p>
<p>More prosaically, fuel economy is rated at 38.2mpg for the V300d. Don&#039;t expect to match this in urban driving, though.</p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-benz-v-class-2025-review-front-static-0059.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front static 0059" title="Mercedes Benz V Class 2025 Review front static 0059" /></p>
<div>
<p>The V-Class delivers where it matters. Interior tech is now a real strong point, and Mercedes&#039; MPV feels more premium than ever inside.</p>
<p>It also continues to generate an appreciably car-like driving experience, despite its unambiguously van-derived architecture.</p>
<p>Sure, you will need to swallow hard before handing over the best part of a hundred grand for a van with windows, but the classy and capable V-Class remains a top choice for a captain of industry with a sizeable entourage.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/renault_4_savane_4x4_concept_-_static_front_three_quarters.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="Renault 4 Savane 4x4 concept   static front three quarters" title="Renault 4 Savane 4x4 concept   static front three quarters" /><figcaption>Renault 4 Savane 4x4 concept   static front three quarters</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Renault has strongly hinted that the new 4 crossover will gain a 4x4 variant with the unveiling of a new off-road-influenced concept called the Savane.</p>
<p>Reprising the name of an adventure-themed variant of the original <a href="/car-review/renault/4-e-tech">Renault 4</a>, this new concept rides 15mm higher than the standard car, features bespoke utility-style wheels wrapped in grippy Goodyear tyres, and is decked out inside with &#039;deep brown&#039; textiled fabrics. </p>
<p>It also has widened tracks and contrasting black body cladding in a nod to its enhanced off-road potential.</p>
<p>But more importantly – as signalled by the bespoke 4x4 badging – the Savane is most obviously differentiated from the standard front-wheel-drive car by the addition of a second motor on the rear axle, to give permanent four-wheel drive. </p>
<p>Renault has not given any technical details, but the FWD car comes with either a 118bhp or 148bhp motor, so if the 4x4 has another one of them at the back, it could produce somewhere in the region of 300bhp - which would give it comparable performance to the twin-motor <a href="/car-review/skoda/elroq">Skoda Elroq</a> vRS.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/renault_4_savane_4x4_concept_-_4x4_badge.jpg?itok=H_sNAmDA" width="900" /></p>
<p>Renault has not officially stated its plans to introduce an AWD 4, but the Savane concept shows that its Ampr Small architecture can accommodate a dual-motor set-up, which the firm says shows the potential "to create a B-segment electric vehicle with four-wheel drive". </p>
<p>A Renault spokesperson told Autocar that the firm is "currently studying the technical feasibility and the financial equation", but added: "We can&#039;t confirm anything yet about the arrival of a production 4x4.<span>"</span></p>
<p>If it reaches showrooms, the 4 4x4 will be among the smallest <a href="/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> available with a twin-motor powertrain.  </p>
<p>The unveiling of a twin-motor 4 also opens the possibility of its lower-riding <a href="/car-review/renault/5">Renault 5</a> sibling adopting the same set-up, though it is unclear if that car&#039;s more compact body and floorpan would allow for the installation of a motor at the rear. </p>
<p>The original 4 was always a more rugged and outdoorsy take on the people&#039;s car than the contemporary Renault 5 city car, though, and the two cars&#039; electric descendants have taken on similar billings.</p>
<p>In fact, the new 4 was previewed in 2022 with an extreme rally raid-influenced concept called the Trophy - which nodded to the rallying prowess of its 1970s namesake, and strongly hinted at Renault&#039;s plans to one day introduce an off-road-ready variant. The company has never voiced any plans for a twin-motor 5.</p>
<p>If the smaller car can take a twin-motor set-up, though, it has significant implications for the 5-based <a href="/car-review/alpine/a290">Alpine A290</a> hot hatch, which would theoretically be in line for a substantial power boost and could take advantage of torque vectoring across its two axles to enhance its agility and responsiveness. </p>

<p>Proportions more arresting than elegant. Superfluous, slash-like indentations above the wheel housings.</p>
<p>Double-blistered headlamp covers, deep-recessed taillights, an aluminium flip-top fuel filler, an aluminium key-fob and a bold repeat of the car’s exterior colour arcing across the dashboard. </p>
<p>This was the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-fiat-coupe">Fiat Coupé</a>, a car unexpectedly signaling that its maker was ready to build sports cars again, and a car signaling the arrival of one Chris Bangle, a designer who would soon stir up the car industry like few designers before him.</p>
<p>This car was a surprise not just for its shape, but because <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/fiat">Fiat</a> had previously said that it would no longer make pure <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-sports-cars">sports cars</a>, despite a glorious run in the 1960s that included the pretty 850 Coupé and Spider, the 124 Spider, the 124 and 128 Coupés, the Dino Coupé and the exquisite Fiat Dino Spider. </p>
<p>That was before Paolo Cantarella arrived to take charge of Fiat Auto in 1989.</p>
<p>Cantarella was a businessman who had previously managed the Fiat Group’s industrial robot division Comau, but he was also a car enthusiast, and acutely aware of the Italian car industry’s past successes</p>
<p>Like any CEO, his overriding mission was to keep the Fiat Auto motor running sweetly, and while Puntos and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/fiat/panda-2012-2024">Pandas</a> sold by the trainload, the bigger Tipos and Cromas were more of a struggle. </p>
<p>The Fiat brand needed some burnishing and, if the numbers could be made to work, this new coupé could help. </p>
<p>Work began around 1991 at both Fiat Centro Stile and Pininfarina, the pair producing quite different proposals. </p>
<p>Pininfarina’s was crisp, subtle, well-proportioned, elegant and conventional. </p>
<p>Fiat’s in-house suggestion bordered on the outlandish, its wheel arches capped with angled elliptical blisters in black, a crease bisecting the upper third of its doors at exactly the same angle. Its tail was short, its boot lid no more than a modest capping.</p>
<p>It wasn’t beautiful but it was daring, original and fresh. Fiat bravely went with this proposal rather than Pininfarina’s, and while the finished article grew a longer and appealingly pert tail, the spirit of Bangle’s startling design survived largely intact. </p>
<p>Pininfarina’s interior suggestion featuring a swathe of body colour paneling across dashboard and doors easily won the interior competition, the coachbuilder also winning the manufacturing contract.</p>
<p>The business case was strengthened by using a cut-down Tipo hatchback platform, engines from the Lancia Delta Integrale and plenty of shared parts. </p>
<p>Few of these were visible, however, the Fiat was as memorable for the bespoke detail in its design as for its highly individual look. And there were more than the slashes and the fuel cap to savour. </p>
<p>The bonnet was a huge clamshell pressing that rose skywards complete with grille and headlights. The headlights themselves were odd enough to have been questioned during Fiat’s internal design reviews, one manager asking how they might be cleaned with headlight washers, given their contours and near-horizontal mounting. </p>
<p>‘Con amore,’ came the smiling reply, an answer that closed the conversation down.</p>
<p>Front-wheel drive and Tipo-based the Coupé may have been, but it rolled on a well-sorted chassis propelled by rorty, sporting engines, the potent turbo version featuring a viscous coupling limited-slip differential that did a great job of firing torque to Tarmac. </p>
<p>The 16V turbo was quick, the 217bhp five-cylinder turbo rabidly so, scoring 6.5sec sprints to 62mph and 155mph. This Fiat was more about outright grip than throttle-adjustable handling finesse, making for slightly less-than-stellar entertainment, but as a total package, complete with four usable seats and a fair boot, it worked.</p>
<p>Fiat launched its coupé with the memorable claim that, ‘In Italy, no-one grows up wanting to be a train driver’, together with a fine picture of the machine in broom yellow. Ironically, Fiat owned the company that made the rapid Pendolino high-speed train at the time, but no-one cared about that – this Fiat was exciting.</p>
<p>Prices are edging up, but somehow this Fiat doesn’t yet feel a complete classic despite its credentials, and despite some bold pricing from optimistic vendors.</p>

  Chery&#039;s Aimoga division recently revealed the humanesque Mornine robot</blockquote>
<figcaption>Chery Aimoga robot in a car dealership</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Seven years ago, almost to the month, <a href="/car-reviews/honda">Honda</a> announced it would scrap its long-running Asimo humanoid robot programme. The dream of the robot butler popularised by comic books in the 1950s looked to have died with it.</p>
<p>Since then, however, the rapid pace of development in electronics, sensors, robotics and artificial intelligence has persuaded car companies including <a href="/car-reviews/byd">BYD</a>, <a href="/car-reviews/tesla">Tesla</a>, <a href="/car-reviews/hyundai">Hyundai</a>, Chery and <a href="/car-reviews/xpeng">Xpeng</a> that robots are suitably product-adjacent enough for them to spend big on producing Asimos of their own.</p>
<p>Such is the buzz about the potential market for these machines either in the home or workplace that at least two of those car companies – Tesla and Chery - are predicting sales will outstrip those of its cars. </p>
<p>Some of the more bullish financial analysts agree. “Over the long term, we project the market for humanoid robots to be materially larger than the global auto industry,” Morgan Stanley autos analyst and Tesla permabull Adam Jonas wrote in a recent report, in which he forecast the market would be worth $50 trillion (£38tn) by 2050 with 63 million jobs replaced.</p>
<p>China and the US are leading the charge, with humanoid robots showing off their (still-limited) moves at both the <a href="/car-news/ces">CES</a> technology show in Las Vegas in January and the <a href="/car-news/shanghai-motor-show">Shanghai motor show </a>in April.</p>
<p>Most impressive was perhaps Chery’s Mornine from its Aimoga division – an unquestionably female robot decked out with wraparound shades and long blonde hair that could walk, hand you a drink and hold a conversation of sorts via integration with China’s cut-price AI large language model DeepSeek.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/chery_aimoga_robot_in_front_of_omoda_7.jpg?itok=nw1c9Gx-" width="900" /></p>
<p>Chery is launching the robot first as an “intelligent sales consultant” in brand dealerships globally, including those for <a href="/car-reviews/omoda">Omoda</a> and <a href="/car-reviews/jaecoo">Jaecoo</a>, and has already begun trialling it at a showroom in Malaysia.</p>
<p>During an event held for the benefit of Chery’s global dealer network in April, Zhang Guibing, president of Chery International, touted Mornine’s abilities to help out showroom staff by answering questions on model specs and he encouraged dealers to buy one of the 220 robots Chery plans to make this year, at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>However, the longer-range goal is to sell the robots alongside the cars. “Aimoga is the real future for the Chery company,” Zhang told the crowd “The market is huge. One assistant for living, one assistant for your job.”</p>
<p>No price was given but robots are currently still prohibitively expensive. A study by the Bank of America put the bill of materials for a robot currently at around $35,000 (roughly £26,500). Last year, Morgan Stanley calculated that Tesla’s Optimus would cost between $50,000-$60,000 (around £37,500-£45,000) to make, while automotive supplier Sona Comstar, a big name in the actuators that robots will need, estimates between $35,000 to $50,000.</p>
<p>That’s before factoring in all the other expenses as well as a profit margin.</p>
<p>That price will come down, though. Tesla is hoping to sell its Optimus robot from between $20,000 and $30,000 (roughly £15,000-£22,500) by 2026, while the Bank of America estimates the bill of materials for the average humanoid robot will fall to $17,000 (about £12,750) by 2030. </p>
<p>The drop will come from a combination of an improvement in component design, a cut in the cost of sensors, including lidar, and the economies of scale that will result from the predicted ramping up of production of something that currently isn’t built anywhere in volume.</p>
<p>“Almost everything in Optimus is new,” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the company’s earnings call in April. “There&#039;s not like an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really anything in the Optimus apart from the AI for Tesla.”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/chery_aimoga_robots.jpg?itok=Al2lf4ll" width="900" /></p>
<p>However, some are already dangling the prospect of lower prices. <a href="/car-reviews/byd">BYD</a>, for example, announced in April a new humanoid robot butler costing from $10,000 (£7500) with deliveries promised in December. When the so-called BoYoboD is low on batteries, it’ll go and stand in the sun to recharge via solar. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China’s Unitree showed off the $16,000 (£12,000) G1 humanoid robot at CES.</p>
<p>Of course, car companies have been at the forefront of robotics for years as they continue to automate more elements of vehicle production. But in general the large robots that are welding, painting and glueing on the assembly line are caged creatures programmed to perform a single task. </p>
<p>Only recently has the idea of ‘cobots’, collaborative robots, been introduced into the factory space, where they are still fixed in place but are aware enough of their surroundings to work safely alongside human employees line-side.</p>
<p>Humanoid robots are newer still, with <a href="/car-reviews/mercedes-benz">Mercedes </a>this year launching a pilot project at its Berlin facility with the aim that they will work alongside humans from around 2030. <a href="/car-reviews/ford">Ford</a> has a robot dog built by Boston Dynamics (owned by Hyundai) patrolling its Kuga plant in Valencia, Spain, to sniff out oil leaks among other tasks. And <a href="/car-reviews/bmw">BMW</a> has started working with a Figure 02 robot to sort sheet metal parts at its Spartanburg plant in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Cars and humanoid robots are entirely compatible in terms of development, argues He Xiaopeng, co-founder and CEO of China’s Xpeng. “If you have a very early preparation, you can definitely create a lot of synergies across different domains,” he said on the company’s earnings call in March. “For example, what we are developing right now is the level three capability for our autonomous driving vehicles. And this physical-world, AI model is definitely compatible with the humanoid robot&#039;s level three capability.”</p>
<p>Xpeng is another car maker planning robot production in 2026 but there are hurdles in the way. “It&#039;s actually more challenging than even producing AI vehicles,” said He.</p>
<p>According to He, the promise of all the show robots is not actually translating yet to a useful product. “A lot of our peers are actually focusing on the lower body motion capability of humanoid robots,” he said. “And I believe that is still very limiting because it&#039;s restricting themselves to the level two kind of capability, which is not enough.”</p>
<p>Xpeng claims to have solved basic lower body capability as well as movement in the arms, mouth and also some brain capability. However, the future is still looking “very foggy”, He told investors. “It’s very hard to predict when the turning point will come technologically and commercially,” He said, adding that in terms of development, humanoid robots are roughly where EVs were 15 years ago.</p>
<p>As with EVs, China is the key to the success of humanoid robots, as noted somewhat gloomily by Musk amid his trademark bombastic predictions on the investor call. “With respect to humanoid robots, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any company that matches Tesla,” he said. “And then I&#039;m a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies.”</p>
<p>The Bank of America’s prediction of a $35,000 bill of material cost by the end of this year was only achieved on its most of the components being made in China. </p>
<p>“Currently, the [humanoid robot] supply chain is pretty much dominated out of China,” Vivek Singh, CEO of suppler Sona Comstar, told investors in April. The Indian-based company is looking to capitalise on firms wanting to diversify out of China.</p>
<p>Tesla might be one. Musk admitted that production of the first Optimus robots was affected by the Chinese ban on the export of rare-earth materials to the US amid the trade war between the two countries. The US’s speedy negotiation of a lower tariff rate for Chinese goods was perhaps a recognition of how far China is ahead of the US on supply chain for tech-focused future products like robots.</p>
<p>But first, these robot developers need to convince private individuals or companies that they need to spend £20,000 or more on a robot to make tea, sell cars, replace the night-time cleaning crew or whatever menial job a humanoid robot might turn out to be good at.</p>
<p>As Singh noted: “If you have the greatest product in your lab and you can&#039;t sell a single unit, it doesn&#039;t really have any meaning.”</p>

  Production version of ID GTI is due next year as first of new family of EV hot hatches</blockquote>
<figcaption>volkswagen id gti front three quarter</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Volkswagen is preparing to expand the GTI performance brand across multiple model lines in the electric era - and CEO Thomas Schäfer says the hot new models will be "mind-blowing" to drive.</p>
<p>The company is preparing to take GTI electric in 2026 with the production version of the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/vw’s-first-electric-gti-focus-go-kart-fun-and-drivability">ID GTI concept</a> - which will be the hot range-topping variant of the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/2025-volkswagen-id-2-will-be-even-better-concept">ID 2</a> supermini.</p>
<p>A potent version of the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-golf-full-details-hatchbacks-high-tech-rebirth">electric ninth-generation Golf</a> will follow by the end of the decade - and these two cars will "start a whole group of GTI" models due to be rolled out in the coming years across Volkswagen&#039;s electric line-up.</p>
<p>Schäfer revealed that work is well under way on development of the first GTI EVs and he pledged that they will remain true to the characteristics of every GTI model that has gone before.</p>
<p>"First of all: can you make an electric Golf exciting? Absolutely," he said. "We have driven a few prototypes that we have built on the new set-up and it is mind-blowing."</p>
<p>Schäfer said the overarching priority of the electric GTI engineering programme is to make these next-gen hot hatchbacks feel obviously different from the standard car. "What about the sound? What about the total feel? The handling and so on can be done," he said.</p>
<p>But it will be a few years before Volkswagen shows a production-ready electric <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti">Golf GTI</a>, with today&#039;s petrol-powered car due to remain on sale well into the second half of the 2020s.</p>
<p>Schäfer said: "We have time now, as the Golf is running very well into the end of this decade, and at the end of the decade, we&#039;ll bring an electric Golf."</p>
<p>He added that his experience of the prototypes suggests the next GTI will be "a monster car".</p>
<p>"I&#039;m very happy with the progress," he said. "It&#039;s cool and you can make it exciting. It has to be exciting and it has to be authentic."</p>
<p>Schäfer did not give any indication of when Volkswagen will reveal the final version of the ID 2 GTI, but the standard car is due to be launched in early 2026, which is also the 50th anniversary of the launch of the original Mk1 Golf GTI - opening the possibility of a debut at the firm&#039;s annual GTI festival in Wolfsburg next summer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Volkswagen plans to mark the occasion with a new special <a href="/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-unveil-50th-anniversary-golf-gti-nurburgring-24hr">50th anniversary version of today&#039;s Golf GTI</a> at the Nürburgring 24 Hours in June.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/autocar_electric_cars_with_the_longest_range.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="Autocar electric cars with the longest range" title="Autocar electric cars with the longest range" /><figcaption>Autocar electric cars with the longest range</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>For many buyers, one number defines an EV: range.</p>
<p>Which is understandable. Early <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> didn’t go far between charges, and public chargers were few and far between. Take the 2010 <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/nissan/leaf">Nissan Leaf</a> - the first mass-market EV - which managed just 100 miles and took eight hours to charge at home.</p>
<p>Times have thankfully changed. Even the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/electric-cars/cheapest-electric-cars">cheapest electric cars</a> of today can double the Leaf’s range and recharge in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Thanks to major advances in battery and motor tech, some modern EVs can now go as far on a charge as petrol cars do on a full tank.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the 10 longest-range electric cars on sale in the UK, based on official WLTP figures. Real-world results will vary and you are unlikely to achieve these figures unless you drive gently, in warm weather, or know a thing or two about hypermiling.</p>
<p>The longest-range electric car on sale in the UK is the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqs">Mercedes-Benz EQS</a> with an impressive 481-mile range. Curious about the rest? Let’s get into it.</p>
</div>
<h2>1. Mercedes-Benz EQS</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mercedes-eqs-450-rt-2025-intro-me-35_0.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range: </strong>481 miles</p>
<p>The Mercedes-Benz EQS boasts the longest range of any EV on sale in the UK today, delivering 481 miles from its enormous 118kWh battery. </p>
<p>It&#039;s helped significantly by its impressive drag coefficient of 0.20, which makes it the slipperiest car currently in production. </p>
<p>Even if you do somehow manage to drain the battery in one go, you won’t have to wait long to fill it back up again: it can accept charging speeds of up to 200kW, so a 10-80% top-up will take just half an hour. </p>
<p>The only real downside is that a new one will set you back more than £100,000… </p>
</div>
</p><h2>2. Audi A6 E-tron</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/audi-s6-avant-e-tron-2025_review-front-tracking-0006_0.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range: </strong>463 miles</p>
<p>The A6&#039;s impressive on-paper range of 463 miles eclipses that of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i5">BMW i5</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/eqe">Mercedes-Benz EQE</a>.</p>
<p>In classic A6 fashion, drivers can choose between saloon and estate bodystyles, although the latter does sacrifice 26 miles of range, as it&#039;s slightly less aerodynamic.</p>
<p>The line-up opens with the 362bhp rear-motor model and is topped by the sporty S6 E-tron, which gets 543bhp.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>3. Polestar 3</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/longest_range_electric_cars_-_polestar_3.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 438 miles</p>
<p>Swedish EV brand Polestar’s smart-looking new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-suvs">SUV</a> comes with some seriously impressive stats.</p>
<p>It carries a massive 111kWh battery that, in combination with a single rear-mounted motor, offers a range of 438 miles. </p>
<p>It has plenty of muscle too, with 295bhp and 361lb ft of torque available, propelling it from 0-62mph in 7.8sec - enough to challenge most other vehicles on the road today. </p>
<p>Genuinely fun to drive, the 3 is one of the best-handling cars in the class. And the most important aspects of its drivetrain are adjustable, including its supple air suspension, steering weight and power delivery, so you can truly make the driving experience your own. </p>
</div>
</p><h2>4. Volkswagen ID 7</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-id-7-front-quarter-cornering.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="longest-range electric cars VW ID7" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range: </strong>436 miles</p>
<p>Effectively the new-age, electric equivalent to the popular Passat, the ID 7 serves as a statement of intent for Volkswagen’s next generation of EVs.</p>
<p>It introduces the company&#039;s new, more efficient ‘AP550’ rear motor, which brings a boost to efficiency.</p>
<p>With the largest-available battery (in the Pro S model), it will afford 436 miles and charge as fast as 200kW.</p>
<p>Even the entry-level Match model offers 381 miles, although the sporty GTX drops slightly to 365 miles. </p>
<p>There’s also an estate version, called the ID 7 Tourer, which trades nine miles of range for greater practicality. It has a whopping 1714 litres of boot space with the rear seats folded down.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>5. Tesla Model 3</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-3-road-test-review-20-24-01-cornering-front_0.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="longest electric car range Tesla Model 3" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 436 miles</p>
<p>Tesla’s incredibly popular compact saloon gained a substantial update in 2024, receiving sleeker styling, an updated interior and efficiency updates. </p>
<p>The American EV brand has certainly delivered on its promises, with the Model 3 now offering 436 miles of range in Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive guise. </p>
<p>In addition to that long range, you get some serious performance. The aforementioned variant gets 351bhp for a 0-62mph time of 4.9sec, which is enough to challenge most <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-sports-cars">sports cars</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless of which specification you choose, the Model 3 will always officially offer you more than 350 miles of range, and with that power and a 594-litre boot, what else could you ask for? Maybe some physical buttons… </p>
</div>
</p><h2>6. Peugeot e-3008</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/peugeot-e-3008-review-2024-01-front-cornering_0_1.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range: </strong>435 miles</p>
<p>Peugeot&#039;s latest-generation 3008 has morphed into an SUV-coupé to better differentiate it from the rest of the French brand&#039;s line-up. </p>
<p>It’s the first car based on Peugeot parent company Stellantis’s new STLA Medium platform, which places a high priority on energy efficiency, and that means there’s ample space for a huge 97kWh battery. </p>
<p>The e-3008 is capable of yielding 4.5mpkWh, so cars with the 98kWh battery pack can do 435 miles on a single charge. Charging rates are capped at 160kW, though, which isn’t best in class.</p>
</div>
</p><h2>7. Mercedes-Benz EQE</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/longest_range_evs_mercedes_eqe.jpg" width="1200" height="795" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> <span>429 miles</span></p>
<p>Mercedes&#039; mid-sized electric saloon is one of its rangiest EVs, with figures starting from 342 miles.</p>
<p>One specification stands out from the rest: the EQE 350+ Sport Edition, which offers a range of 429 miles. </p>
<p>In addition, it can accept charging speeds of up to 170kW and has decent all-round performance figures. </p>
<p>Power and torque stand at 290bhp and 416lb ft, propelling the EQE from 0-62mph in a hot-hatch-esque 6.5sec. </p>
</div>
</p><h2>8. BMW iX</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/bmw-ix_0.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="" /></p><p><div>
<p><strong>Range: </strong>426 miles</p>
<p>BMW’s most challenging-looking car breaks back into the top 10 after a hefty update.</p>
<p>The new front end hasn’t made it any less controversial looking, but the improved battery packs and more efficient motors have resulted in a massive boost to range.</p>
<p>The top-spec xDrive 60 now offers up to 426 miles, which is impressive because it also has 537bhp and a 0-62mph time of less than 5.0sec.</p>

<p><strong>Range: </strong>422 miles</p>
<p>Porsche’s debut EV recently received a generational upgrade, with a new rear motor bringing extra power, torque and efficiency, and the reworked battery adopting a different chemistry for lower internal resistance. </p>
<p>The result is a massive improvement in the GT&#039;s range: entry-level versions with the optional 105kWh Performance Battery Plus can cover 422 miles between charges. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/best-cars/best-7-seat-cars">Seven-seaters</a> lend themselves to electrification, because their large platforms allow huge batteries, and the e-5008’s impressive range comes courtesy of the 98kWh unit also seen in the smaller e-3008.</p>
<p>We’ve yet to verify the range, but we reckon the e-5008 should get pretty close to the 414-mile claimed total.</p>
<p>Away from the big mileage claims, the e-5008 has reassuringly tidy handling for a big seven-seater, and it will seat four tall adults and a couple of older kids in the rear without too much elbow-bashing. </p>

<div>
<p>While everyone was swooning over the new <a href="/car-review/toyota/gr86">Toyota GR86</a> and subsequently getting worked up that you can’t actually buy one, some might have forgotten that if you want a lightweight, front-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports car with a manual gearbox, you could simply go to a <a href="/car-review/mazda">Mazda</a> showroom and buy a <strong>Mazda MX-5</strong> all along.</p>
<p>The current generation of the Mazda MX-5, codenamed the ND, was brilliant when it launched in 2015, and because it’s such a timeless concept, it hasn’t aged a day. It also helps that Mazda has kept it fresh with model-year tweaks here and there – some small, some quite significant.</p>
<p>Other long-running nameplates, such as the <a href="/car-review/mercedes-amg/sl">Mercedes SL</a>, have markedly changed in character throughout their run, but the MX-5 still fulfils much the same role as it did when it first went on sale in 1989.</p>
<p>It came about as the result of an American wistfulness for cheap British roadsters on the one hand, and a Japanese firm’s readiness to speculate and innovate in order to make its global reputation on the other. ‘<a href="/car-news/anything-goes-throwback-thursday/1990-mazda-mx-5-road-test-throwback-thursday">Mazda Experiment, Project Number Five</a>’ would go on to become the world’s fastest-selling <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-sports-cars">sports car</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of an affordable open-top was hardly new to Japan. Preceding decades had seen oddities such as the Datsun Fairlady, <a href="/review/honda">Honda</a> S500 and <a href="/review/toyota">Toyota</a> Sports 800 emerge, often as their fledgling makers’ first production models. But by the end of the 1970s, with the demise of such icons as the Triumph Spitfire, <a href="/review/mg">MG</a> B and original <a href="/review/lotus">Lotus</a> <a href="/opinion/new-cars/steve-cropley-why-lotus-elan-gets-my-last-garage-spot">Elan</a>, the segment was assumed to be in decline. </p>
<p>It was these models, though, that Mazda dissected during the MX-5’s development, and they are among the reasons why it emerged in 1989 as a small, sub-one-tonne, front-engined, rear-drive, perfectly balanced home run.</p>
<p>Ironically, the MX-5’s success found a counterpoint almost immediately in the lukewarm reception and ailing sales figures that greeted the all-new Lotus Elan, which emerged only a few months later, lumbered as it was by a higher price, lumpier looks and front-wheel drive. </p>
<p>The first MX-5 – the NA – was arguably the model’s dynamic high point. Its successors were generally very good too, but they became progressively more powerful, bigger, heavier and that bit less exciting to drive. </p>
<p>Until the current ND generation, that is. It was a return to the old template: shorter, lower, wider and – most importantly – lighter than its predecessor, the ND MX-5 comes with a choice of either 1.5 or 2.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engines and the promise of unparalleled ‘Jinba ittai’ – the manufacturer’s catch-all term for oneness between car and driver.</p>
<h2>Range at a glance</h2>
<p>Ever since its launch in 2015, the ND-generation MX-5 has been available with a 1.5-litre four-cylinder and a 2.0-litre four-cylinder, both naturally aspirated. In 2018, both got updated, but while the changes for the 1.5 were mild, the 2.0-litre got an extra 23bhp and a 700rpm-higher redline. All MX-5s come with a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, but the 2.0-litre can be optioned with a six-speed torque-converter automatic.</p>
<p>Through the years, trim levels have come and gone, and there have been more special editions than stars in the universe. In 2017, Mazda added an RF (for ‘Retractable Fastback’) model with a metal folding roof to the line-up. It can be had with both engine options.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-33-1600x1067-38c0290a-c6fc-4fb2-a6c6-54cc1f9bca78_1.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 33 1600x1067 38c0290a c6fc 4fb2 a6c6 54cc1f9bca78 (1)" title="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 33 1600x1067 38c0290a c6fc 4fb2 a6c6 54cc1f9bca78 (1)" /></p>
<div>
<p>Size and weight were major preoccupations for the project’s engineers. No one would describe the original Mazda MX-5 as large, yet this latest model has been made 55mm shorter still. It’s the most compact Mazda MX-5 yet and, save for the original, the lightest. </p>
<p>Throughout the development, a rigorous ‘gram strategy’ was applied to ensure that the roadster had no superfluous mass. Thus the all-new suspension, still consisting of front wishbones and rear multi-links, is 12kg lighter thanks to its aluminium components. The engine frame is aluminium, as are the front wings and bumper reinforcements.</p>
<p>The front crossmember is high-tensile steel, a much higher proportion of which is used in the body, too. The rear crossmember benefits from a more rigid truss structure, while suspension mounts have been reinforced all round. The result is a claimed 100kg reduction in kerb weight compared with the 2005-2015 <a href="/car-review/mazda/mx-5-2005-2015">NC MX-5</a>.</p>
<p>The addition of a metal folding roof in the MX-5 RF increases the overall weight but adds some useful refinement up to 60mph or so. Any faster than that, and the RF actually produces more wind noise than the roadster.</p>
<p>While production-spec ND MX-5s never quite dipped under the magic 1000kg mark, a basic 1.5 model gets very close, without being as stripped out as a <a href="/car-review/caterham/seven-160">Caterham</a> or as overtly spartan as a <a href="/car-review/lotus/elise">Lotus Elise</a>. Moreover, the weight is ideally distributed 50/50 front to back and the centre of gravity is slightly lower than in previous generations.</p>
<p>Mazda’s seriousness about making this MX-5 fun to drive by adding lightness is welcome – and crucial when you consider that this was the first model to use electromechanical power steering. It’s a compact dual-pinion set-up located close to the front wheels for increased stiffness. It has a marginally quicker ratio than that of the previous car, while the front wheels’ castor angle is increased for better resistance to understeer.</p>
<p>The MX-5’s engines and gearboxes have been made to measure. Despite being used elsewhere in Mazda’s line-up, each has been fettled for the MX-5.</p>
<p>The 1.5-litre Skyactiv-G petrol engine – related to the one in the <a href="/car-review/mazda/2">Mazda 2</a> and <a href="/car-review/mazda/3">Mazda 3</a> hatchbacks – got revised cam timing, a custom crankshaft and a 7500rpm redline, while the 158bhp 2.0-litre version added a lightened flywheel and pistons, as well as a limited-slip differential.</p>
<p><a href="/car-review/mazda/mx-5/first-drives/mazda-mx-5-skyactiv-g-20-2018-first-drive">Both engines were revised in 2018</a>. The 1.5 gained just 1bhp, but the 2.0-litre underwent a more substantial transformation that added 23bhp thanks to lighter pistons and conrods, a wider throttle body and enlarged port area, as well as a bigger-bore exhaust valve. This also had the side effect of putting peak power 1000rpm higher in the rev range, at the same 7000rpm as the 1.5.</p>
<p>2024 brought another, more minor update, but still a very welcome one. It included subtly redesigned headlights and taillights, a new two-tone wheel style on Exclusive-Line trim, and a number of interior upgrades.</p>
<p>The steering and throttle were retuned as well, and the The 2.0-litre received an upgraded limited-slip differential. Mazda calls it the Asymmetric LSD, as it acts differently under acceleration and deceleration. Upper trims also got a refined stability control system, which gained a half-way house &#039;track mode&#039;.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-8-1607x1072-9d5cabac-75bb-45e7-87fa-17d80c537596.jpg" width="1607" height="1072" alt="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 8 1607x1072 9d5cabac 75bb 45e7 87fa 17d80c537596" title="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 8 1607x1072 9d5cabac 75bb 45e7 87fa 17d80c537596" /></p>
<div>
<p>The ND MX-5 is positively geriatric in the context of model cycles. Nevertheless, the no-nonsense interior still feels fresh. It was a huge leap compared with the <a href="/car-review/mazda/mx-5-2005-2015">NC generation</a>, but if you’re unaccustomed to MX-5s, it’s likely that the cabin’s incredibly compact dimensions will need to sink in before you can meaningfully survey the details. The MX-5 has always been resolutely bijou, and the ND is no different.</p>
<p>Broader adults will find themselves in frequent contact with the centre console, door trim and the sides of the skinny footwell, while taller drivers will want for a few centimetres more leg room.</p>
<p>Despite a 20mm lower hip point compared with the NC, you sit a little higher than would seem optimal and head room with the top up is relatively limited. Moreover, there is a bulge in the floorpan that denies you the option of folding your clutch leg away on motorways (a malaise of right-hand-drive cars only). Reach adjustment for the steering wheel was added in 2018.</p>
<p>If you plan to do long distances in your MX-5, seek out a version with the Recaro seats, because they are significantly more comfortable than the standard items, and offer more lateral support too. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-6-1600x1067-3dd1e271-33d2-4c0e-88a6-6f2b4b209a90.jpg?itok=whOfnwE3" width="900" /></p>
<p>These factors can combine to make it tricky to get comfortable – tricky enough, in fact, for some people to be put off the prospect entirely, although others will proclaim this the most comfortable MX-5 yet.</p>
<p>More fool the critics, though, because in an age that tends towards profligacy, the MX-5’s cockpit-sized simplicity – once reconciled with – makes for a charming environment. The dashboard architecture is similar to that of the <a href="/car-review/mazda/2">Mazda 2</a>, which is a good thing because the same natty design features and chunky, tactile switchgear work equally well here in the roadster. You’ll have to look hard to find soft-touch materials, but that somehow feels appropriate for a no-nonsense sports car.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the MX-5’s simplicity better encapsulated than in the manually operated roof. Made 3kg lighter than in the NC and requiring 30lb ft less effort to close, the hood can be operated easily with one hand, even when moving. There’s one spring-loaded clip to unfasten on the header rail, then a click somewhere in the housing behind you to confirm that it’s safely stowed. It takes four or five seconds and, like pretty much everything else about the MX-5, puts everything larger, heavier and motor-driven to shame. </p>
<p>The roof’s tiny size means that the car continues to offer a modest-sized but usable boot. It’s too small for golf clubs but is just big enough for two weekend-away bags. Which seems to us exactly as it should be. </p>
<h2>Multimedia system</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/10-mazda-mx-5-review-2024-multimedia.jpg?itok=YgvkzIQY" width="900" /></p>
<p>Over its many years on sale, the MX-5 has gone through a number of infotainment iterations, but the good news is that all of them are quite pleasant to use because they were clearly modelled on the classic <a href="/car-review/bmw">BMW</a> iDrive.</p>
<p>Cars up to 2023 used an older interface, but one which still had logical menus and could be navigated using both the touchscreen and the rotary controller in the centre console. Entry-level models used to miss out on the centre screen, but from 2023, all MX-5s have the 7.0in touchscreen.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple CarPlay </a>and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto">Android Auto</a> were added, the former with wireless functionality. They do come with a Mazda-typical quirk. The touchscreen stops working on the move and you have to use the rotary controller. The latter works great for the native interface, but using it to navigate CarPlay is rather awkward, as that was clearly designed for a touchscreen</p>
<p>In 2024, the screen was upgraded to a 8.8in screen with much more modern-looking graphics. Thankfully, that didn&#039;t come at a cost of usability – all the menus remain very logical, and the built-in navigation is actually quite good.</p>
<p>The standard stereo isn’t anything special, but it’s just about brawny enough to be heard over the road and wind noise. The Bose system that used to be available on certain trims put up a better fight, but as this is quite a noisy car on the motorway, it’s always a bit of a losing battle.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-28-1600x1067-06831835-fa25-4950-836d-9ffedf76ecdf.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 28 1600x1067 06831835 fa25 4950 836d 9ffedf76ecdf" title="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 28 1600x1067 06831835 fa25 4950 836d 9ffedf76ecdf" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>In a modern context, the MX-5&#039;s engines are quite special – both the 1.5 and the 2.0 – because where else can you find an engine that spins so freely, and with gathering force, to its 7500rpm redline, short of much more expensive <a href="/car-review/porsche">Porsches</a>?</p>
<p>For the 1.5, we’re not talking about a particularly quick full stride, although needing little over eight seconds to hit 60mph from rest, the car is appreciably faster than the 1989 original and close enough to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-hot-hatches">hot hatch</a> pace for respectability.</p>
<p>And yet this MX-5 plays perfectly to arouse your excitement and seize your enthusiasm as a willing hostage. It hardly matters how fast you’re going.</p>
<p>The temptation starts with an unexpectedly rorty exhaust note, which sounds playful and offbeat even at idle. Blip the accelerator out of gear and the revs flare with promising urgency, then engage first and the MX-5’s mechanically detailed and supremely positive shift quality announces itself. You’re already having an absorbing and special driving experience – and you’ve yet to even turn a wheel.</p>
<p>Gearshift aside, the car’s controls are light and, being so obliging to control, fairly short-geared and revving cleanly from very low revs, it moves away from a standstill with a pleasing lack of inertia. Add some throttle and you’ll pick up speed gradually at first, with limited mid-range torque on tap but with perfect response and a supremely linear delivery of it as the revs rise. </p>
<p>Get into a flow on a good road, or even an average one, frankly, and you’ll be revelling in the vivid mechanical interaction and the joy of taking a modern sports car to the redline as and when you choose without worrying unduly about the potential consequences for your driving licence.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the 1.5 is sufficient for having a brilliant time in the MX-5. But the 2.0-litre is the better of the two. Since its major upgrades in 2018 it&#039;s been able to mimic the 1.5-litre&#039;s character, its rortyness, its ability to rev, but just with more power and speed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/electrogenics-mazda-mx5-2025-jh-19-1600x1067-25a907b9-7a73-4fe7-a0d8-a4502dc63b1c_1.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="electrogenics mazda mx5 2025 jh 19 1600x1067 25a907b9 7a73 4fe7 a0d8 a4502dc63b1c (1)" title="electrogenics mazda mx5 2025 jh 19 1600x1067 25a907b9 7a73 4fe7 a0d8 a4502dc63b1c (1)" /></p>
<div>
<p>The instincts of many long-standing Mazda MX-5 owners might be to keep the mechanical specification of their car simple, and thereby to give the lauded delicacy of the car’s handling the best chance to thrive.</p>
<p>In reality, the MX-5’s handling doesn’t reward that judicious restraint in unqualified terms, in ways we’ll come to. But that shouldn’t prevent this car from taking its place among the most vibrant, responsive and engaging sports cars available at any price.</p>
<p>From the effortlessness of its hold on the road, through its fine balance and directional agility, to the zapping crispness of its every answer to a few extra degrees of steering angle or throttle, this car remains a true sporting great.</p>
<p>On delicacy, meanwhile, nothing short of a <a href="/car-review/caterham">Caterham</a>, <a href="/car-review/lotus">Lotus</a> or <a href="/car-review/ariel">Ariel</a> can equal what the MX-5 brings to the table. The car’s 195-section tyres produce only moderate but perfectly balanced grip levels and therefore don’t overburden the suspension or steering with cornering forces, and they break away into lateral slip with a wonderfully tender progressiveness.</p>
<p>Some testers found the electromechanical power steering overly light, while others appreciated that it is able to delicately convey information about the road surface and grip levels without adding unnecessary weight and stodginess. Generous angles of body roll introduce some softness in the handling mix under high lateral loads, taking some precision away – if only on the very edge of adhesion.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively soft suspension, the MX-5 can be a bit excitable over very high-frequency lumps and bumps, perhaps an inevitable result of the imperfect torsional rigidity of the convertible body, which doesn’t always let the suspension do its work. The 2.0-litre model seems to suffer slightly more from shimmies and scuttle shake, though.</p>
<p>The rest of the time the MX-5’s ride is easy and fairly laid back. Like that of its forebears, the directional keenness and poise come not from high chassis rates but from the advantages of even weight distribution, a low centre of gravity and driven rear wheels, and so the MX-5 doesn’t feel firm on the road or short of wheel travel. It doesn’t need to.</p>
<p>For a car that offers up as many thrills as the little Mazda does, it is remarkably habitable. The ride is rarely harsh and as long as you’re not too tall to fit, it offers a supremely comfortable driving position, legs outstretched but well supported. The MX-5’s one Achilles heel when it comes to comfort is the road noise. It seeps through the car’s every pore and resulted in a reading of 75dBA at 70mph. The hard-top RF does improve the motorway refinement.</p>
<h2>Track notes</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/electrogenics-mazda-mx5-2025-jh-13.jpg?itok=Rj2-vpEF" width="900" /></p>
<p>The day of our performance tests with the 1.5 started wet but subsequently dried out. It therefore afforded us the opportunity to find out that the MX-5&#039;s delicate dry-surface grip level becomes even more tantalising when a bit of surface water is in the mix. In the wet, an uninterested driver might call that grip level worryingly faint, however, and the Yokohamas’ proclivity to hydroplane can be startling.</p>
<p>In the dry, there&#039;s only just enough power to get the rear wheels to break traction with the accelerator during cornering - and only then at very high revs and by a fleeting few degrees of slip angle. It&#039;s a tenderness of adjustability that you rarely find in a modern car and is no less enjoyable for its subtlety than a 500bhp Jaguar&#039;s handling is for its luridness. </p>
<p>Disengage the ESP - a system that&#039;s fairly sophisticated so long as you don’t try to provoke the car - and there are familiar ways to have fun with your cornering line, either with a trailed brake or an exaggerated, throttle-off steering input.</p>
<p>The MX-5 is sensitive to all. That being said, if on-throttle adjustability is key to your enjoyment of a rear-wheel-drive car, you’ll be much better served by the 2.0-litre, with its additional 51bhp and limited-slip differential.</p>
<p>That is especially the case for 2024 model year cars, which get an upgraded differential and stability control system. In our experience, it seemed very slightly keener to yaw through bends, and the stability control&#039;s track mode lets you have some fun while still keeping an eye out.</p>
<p><img alt="Mx 5 track notes" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mx-5-track-notes.jpg?itok=iZTzgIex" width="900" /></p>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-14.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 14" title="Mazda MX5 LT Murray 2024   ME 14" /></p>
<div>
<p>The MX-5 is no longer the bargain it once was, but then nothing is, and anyway, even distant rivals are thin on the ground. The good news is that the MX-5 is well equipped whichever trim level you go for. </p>
<p>Even the Prime-Line has heated seats, cruise control and the 7.0in touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone mirroring. However, our favourite version is the range-topping Homura, because the 2.0-litre engine gives it enough power for the chassis to have something to think about, and because the LSD, the track setting for the stability control and the recaro seats really complete the package.</p>
<p>Light weight and a small surface area mean both engines can claim excellent real-world efficiency. On a motorway run, 42mpg (2.0-litre) and 50mpg (1.5-litre) are realistic prospects, and even when having fun on twisty roads and using plenty of revs, you’ll struggle to dip below 30mpg in either.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mazda/long-term-reviews/track-nights-drifting-and-lots-screenwash-2000-miles-mx-5"><strong>Read our full long-term report here</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>How comfortable were the seats?</strong></p>
<p>My long-term MX-5 came with Recaro seats – part of the Homura specification. They’re the best that Mazda offers, as they’re just the right side of firm and very supportive. </p>
<p>The seating position - low and centred - is nigh-on perfect and the benchmark for sports cars. I drove the car from London to Wales, completed a track night, then drove back to London the following morning and experienced nothing but comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Did real-world fuel efficiency match the manufacturer&#039;s claims?</strong></p>
<p>My long-termer has the 2.0-litre engine. Mazda claims a WLTP figure of 41.5mpg. My test of around 2000 miles included motorway town and track drive, and it resulted in 39.1mpg.</p>
<p>This is really strong. So often we see manufacturer’s WLTP figures being fairly unachievable in real-world conditions, but the MX-5 excels here, because of its lightweight and long sixth gear, meaning it’s pulling below 3000rpm at motorway speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Was the infotainment system responsive and intuitive?</strong></p>
<p>The infotainment screen is fast and responsive, and I never had any issues hooking up with Apple CarPlay. </p>
<p>But I found it irritating, because the touchscreen can’t be used on the go and you have to use a rotary controller. This turns some functions, such as switching between Spotify and Google Maps on Apple CarPlay, into about 15-20 turns of a controller rather than two prods of a screen.</p>
<p><strong>How practical was it for regular use and trips?</strong></p>
<p>The MX-5 is not a large car. The boot is quite narrow, but it’s big enough for a typical shop for someone without kids. There’s a little bit more storage inside the cabin, with a lockable box behind the seats. </p>
<p>It has two cupholders too, although these are slightly awkward to get to. They’re behind the driver, so you need to make a conscious effort to turn your torso rather than simply extend an arm.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any hidden costs or unexpected foibles?</strong></p>
<p>There were no hidden costs whatsoever. The Mazda was truly reliable during my time with it. The only slightly unexpected thing was the regularity of which I needed to top up with windscreen wash. The reservoir is tiny.</p>
<p>Aftermarket company MX5 Parts sells a fabrication that gains another litre for about £350, which I think is well worth it.</p>
</div>
<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/electrogenics-mazda-mx5-2025-jh-80.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="electrogenics mazda mx5 2025 jh 80" title="electrogenics mazda mx5 2025 jh 80" /></p>
<div>
<p>We’ve grown used to giving couched verdicts on sports cars, sometimes weighing progress in one direction against compromise in another. Not so here.</p>
<p>There isn’t a single area in which the Mazda MX-5 fails to surpass its predecessor. It’s shorter, lighter, more spacious and better laid out. It’s sharper-looking but still disarming and distinctive. It’s faster, more frugal and even more vibrant and engaging to drive.</p>
<p>All that, and yet the MX-5 is still every inch the same zesty and inimitable car that it was. Its character hasn’t altered at all. The 2.0-litre model provides more performance and handling panache than the entry-level car, but you can’t really go wrong with either.</p>
<p>As sporty cars that offer engagement and everyday driving thrills have either fallen by the wayside, and have been replaced by unaffordable plug-in hybrid grip monsters, the MX-5 is still here, providing all pleasures of a sports car or convertible that you could wish for.</p>
<p>With its lack of needless complication, light weight and manual gearbox, the MX-5 flits inertia-free from corner to corner, feeling like a breath of fresh air, even though it is now an eight-year-old design. Mazda’s roadster is arguably more significant and relevant than ever.</p>

<figcaption>Aston Martin Apple Carplay maps on both screens</figcaption></figure><div class="iframe-container-www-youtube-com">
<p>Aston Martin has become the first manufacturer to offer the second generation of Apple&#039;s in-car smartphone mirroring system.</p>
<p><a href="/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple CarPlay</a> Ultra dramatically expands the amount of screen space that the Apple interface can occupy, entering the car&#039;s instrument display as well as its infotainment screen.</p>
<p>This means users can display maps or media alongside the rev counter and speedometer. They will also be able to select one of various designs for the instruments, as well as personalised colours, backgrounds and screen layouts.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions such as the climate and audio controls are now accessible via the CarPlay interface and can be adjusted using Apple&#039;s Siri voice assistant.</p>
<p>“Building on our in-house state-of-the-art infotainment system, CarPlay Ultra will provide additional functionality and personalisation opportunities which place <a href="/car-review/aston-martin">Aston Martin</a> at the forefront of infotainment in the sector,“ said CEO Adrian Hallmark.</p>
<p>The new system will first be rolled out in the US and Canada, then the UK and Europe within the next 12 months.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-embed"></p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzfpbVzSBFg?si=GlbVwwOSfhtE_CFF" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><p></span></p>
<p>CarPlay Ultra will be included as standard in the <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/db12">DB12</a>, <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/vantage">Vantage</a>, <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/vanquish">Vanquish</a> and <a href="/car-review/aston-martin/dbx">DBX 707</a> from the 2025 model year, plus the new <a href="/car-news/new-cars/new-aston-martin-dbx-s-outpunches-purosangue-717bhp">DBX S</a>.</p>
<p>Owners of existing cars with Aston Martin&#039;s latest-generation infotainment system (introduced with the launch of the DB12) will be offered a free software update at official dealerships.</p>
<p>CarPlay was launched in 2014 and first featured in the <a href="/car-review/ferrari/ff-2011-2016">Ferrari FF</a>, with the <a href="/car-review/ferrari/california-t-2014-2017">California T</a> following shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Aston Martin’s current technology boss, Roberto Fedeli, held the same role at <a href="/car-review/ferrari">Ferrari</a> at that time.</p>
<p>By 2016, CarPlay had become an optional extra on many mainstream cars, such as the <a href="/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class">Mercedes-Benz A-Class</a>, <a href="/car-review/peugeot/208">Peugeot 208</a> and <a href="/car-review/volkswagen/golf">Volkswagen Golf</a>, and today it&#039;s rare to see it omitted from the standard kit list on any new car.</p>
<p>Notable exceptions include the <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a>, <a href="/car-review/tesla/model-y">Tesla Model Y</a> and <a href="/car-review/leapmotor/t03">Leapmotor</a> models.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/2025_bz4x-touring_front_34_main.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="2025 bZ4X Touring front 3:4 main" title="2025 bZ4X Touring front 3:4 main" /><figcaption>2025 bZ4X Touring front 3:4 main</figcaption></figure><div>
<p><a href="/car-reviews/toyota">Toyota</a> has revealed a stretched, off-road-focused variant of its <a href="/car-review/toyota/bz4x">bZ4X</a> electric SUV that brings more space and more power.</p>
<p>The bZ4X Touring will arrive in the UK next spring and, as the name suggests, it is an off-Tarmac estate version of the three-year-old EV that adds 140mm in length, 20mm in height and a host of rugged design elements.</p>
<p>Clearly a twin of the new <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-subaru-trailseeker-unveiled-375bhp-4wd-estate">Subaru Trailseeker</a> - both use the same e-TNGA platform – the Touring gets more boot space than its standard SUV equivalent, with an increase of 148 litres to 600 litres. This takes it above the likes of the similarly sized <a href="/car-review/vw/id-5">Volkswagen ID 5</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/byd/sealion-7">BYD Sealion 7 </a>to make it one of the most cavernous on the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric car </a>market.</p>
<p>What’s more, thanks to <a href="/car-reviews/subaru">Subaru</a>’s push for the Trailseeker to feature two identical motors on either axle for better off-road balance (going against Toyota’s previous philosophy of a bigger rear motor), the new Touring puts out 376bhp, up from the SUV’s 338bhp. This cements it as the most powerful electric Toyota available. A 221bhp single-motor set-up is also offered.</p>
<p>Power is drawn from a new 74.4kWh (usable) battery, up from the recently updated car’s 73.1kWh pack. A range figure has yet to be disclosed, but the standard SUV offers up to 318 miles in its most efficient form.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2025_bz4x-touring_rear.jpg?itok=5f16I7fn" width="900" /></p>
<p>Visually, the Touring is more of a rugged proposition than the standard SUV. While it adopts the new front-end look of the recently updated bZ4X SUV, the Touring also features the Trailseeker’s thicker rear light bar and chunkier rear bumper. In addition, it gains roof rails, blackened wheel arches and an exclusive Brilliant Bronze paint scheme.</p>
<p>Inside, the Touring adopts the same interior as the latest bZ4X, which features a new centre console and 14.0in infotainment screen. For the Touring, a City Moss colour has been added.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2025_bz4x-touring_side.jpg?itok=c8E9pVat" width="900" /></p>
<p>Pricing and full UK specifications for the new range-topping variant will be revealed later this year, Toyota says. For reference, the current bZ4X range tops out at £54,000.</p>

<p>The <a href="/car-news/new-cars/renault-will-not-force-twingo-uk-dealers-boost-ev-sales-mix">new Renault Twingo</a> <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric car</a> will arrive in the UK in right-hand-drive form soon after its launch next year, the firm’s boss, Fabrice Cambolive, has confirmed.</p>
<p>The fourth generation of the model is due on sale in mainland Europe next year with a sub-€20,000 (£16,700) starting price, but there had been doubts over whether it would come to the UK because of the cost of converting it to right-hand drive. That had echoes of the original 1990s Twingo, which reached the UK only in <a href="/car-review/renault/twingo-2008-2013">its second generation</a>.</p>
<p>But Cambolive has now confirmed to Autocar that the model will be sold in the UK, citing the strong positive reception of the <a href="/car-review/renault/5">Renault 5</a> and <a href="/car-review/renault/4">4</a> as a key factor.</p>
<p>“The UK is very important in terms of product recognition, because your legacy in terms of cars is very important,” he said. “I’ve followed closely the reaction to the R5 and R4 [in the UK], and with Twingo the exercise will be even more interesting because it’s not only sportiness, agility, design and practicality but we can play on versatility.</p>
<p>“The Twingo can be one of the solutions of mobility for the UK tomorrow. You couldn’t have the genuine Twingo in 1992, because right-hand drive didn’t arrive until a generation after, but I will put all my pressure and my attention to get the Twingo for the UK as soon as possible [after it is launched in mainland Europe].”</p>
<p><img alt="2025 Renault Twingo concept rear" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/renault-twingo-concept-2025-rear-quarter-static_0.jpg?itok=0Krcxg4_" /></p>
<p>Cambolive acknowledged that it hadn’t been easy to make the business case stack up, although it is likely to have been helped by the confirmation that Renault will produce an electric city car based on the <a href="/car-news/electric-cars/official-nissan-gain-renault-twingo-based-city-car-2026">Twingo for Nissan</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking about making the business case work, Cambolive said: “It’s a challenge. We have to be very accessible when we speak about B-segment cars. Each time we are adding diversity and cost, it’s a kind of trade-off we have to do. But when I look at the strong start of sales of R5 in the UK, I don’t want to miss the opportunity to launch Twingo in the UK.”</p>

<p>The <a href="/car-review/ds/4">DS 4</a> has been given a heavy update, bringing in a fresh look, a new name and the option of an electric powertrain for the first time.</p>
<p>The C-segment hatchback has been the French brand’s best-seller in the UK since its 2021 launch, albeit with just 2300 sales. </p>
<p>While it has done much better in Europe, amassing 10,405 sales in 2024,<span> </span><a href="/car-reviews/ds">DS</a> is struggling, with overall deliveries dipping 22.4% last year. </p>
<p>It was recently suggested that parent company <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/stellantis-wont-sell-maserati-despite-ceos-shut-down-warning">Stellantis was ready to offload DS last year</a>, but instead it has publicly backed the brand.</p>
<p>In a bid to rejuvenate itself, DS has brought to market a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-ds-no8-tops-out-%C2%A363290-370bhp-and-426-miles">new flagship SUV in the No8</a> and given its best-seller a wide-reaching update.</p>
<p>This starts with a new name, No4, which follows last year’s new SUV and is part of an effort to move DS back into the premium sphere.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/ds_no4_rear_boot.jpg?itok=NGv_1J7c" width="900" /></p>
<p>Yet, it will be the addition of an electric variant that should give the model added appeal – especially in the UK, where manufacturers are pressed to sell an increased number of EVs. </p>
<p>Using the same powertrain as the similarly sized <a href="/car-reviews/Peugeot/e-408">Peugeot e-408</a> and recently facelifted <a href="/car-review/Citroen/e-C4">Citroën ë-C4</a>, the No4 E-Tense is fitted with a 58.3kWh (net) battery that delivers up to 280 miles of range. </p>
<p>Power is supplied by a single electric motor that sends 210hp and 253lb ft of torque to the front wheels.</p>
<p>A 0-62mph time has yet to be confirmed, but the e-408 can despatch it in 7.6sec.</p>
<p>Like its <a href="/car-review/peugeot">Peugeot</a> sibling, the new DS can be rapid-charged at rates of up to 120kW, allowing for a 62-mile top-up in 11 minutes.</p>
<p>The No4 is again offered with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, this time with a larger and more efficient 14.6kWh battery. This provides as much as 50 miles of electric range, 30% more than the car it replaces.</p>
<p>The PHEV combines a 178bhp turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine with a gearbox-integrated motor for 222bhp and 266lb ft.</p>
<p>The 143bhp mild-hybrid petrol engine is also still offered.</p>
<p>DS has transformed the design of the new No4, bringing it inline with the stylings of the new No8. This is focused on the nose, which now features a new wider and redesigned grille, as well as the same V-shaped light signature as the SUV.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/ds_no4_front.jpg?itok=bl_nq9Xw" width="900" /></p>
<p>The bonnet has also been extended by 12mm. At the rear, new LED lights feature.</p>
<p>In keeping with its push to remain a premium option, 19in alloys are fitted as standard, with 20s offered at a cost.</p>
<p>Inside, the cabin has been subtly revised, with the main change the fitment of a new 10.25in instrument cluster.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="596" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/ds_no4_interior.jpg?itok=PnYmDgNY" width="900" /></p>
<p>The No4 will go on sale later this summer. Pricing has yet to be confirmed, but it will likely raise on today’s £33,235 starting price.</p>

  Polestar has confirmed a power output of up to 874bhp for the 5</blockquote>
<figcaption>Polestar 5 front three quarter</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Polestar will show the final version of its new electric super-saloon at the <a href="/car-news/munich-motor-show">Munich motor show</a> in September.</p>
<p>Remaining largely true to the radical Precept concept that the brand showed in 2020, the <a href="/car-reviews/polestar">Polestar</a> 5 is a <a href="/car-review/porsche/taycan">Porsche Taycan</a> rival with “supercar levels” of stiffness from a British-engineered chassis, an 800V electrical architecture for &#039;extreme fast-charging&#039; and nearly 900bhp in its most potent form.</p>
<p>Polestar has revealed some of the headline specifications and showed a near production-ready prototype back in 2023, but it will give full details and unveil the interior of its long-awaited flagship at Munich in autumn.</p>
<p>Described as a “company-defining project”, the 5 is the first model to be built on a new scalable aluminium architecture that&#039;s bespoke to Polestar and has been engineered at the firm&#039;s development centre at the MIRA proving ground.</p>
<p>This platform will also underpin the drop-top <a href="/car-news/new-cars/polestar-6-‘daily-driver’-supercar-set-longer-production-run">Polestar 6</a> sports car that&#039;s due in 2026.</p>
<p>Polestar has confirmed the 5&#039;s new rapid-charging technology allows for 100 miles of range to be added in just five minutes without degrading the life of the battery.</p>
<p>CEO Michael Lohscheller suggested to Autocar that the introduction of 800V architecture is a technical highlight of the new 5, saying: "The charging time comes down to 18 or 19 minutes. This is really, really good. You will have to hurry to get your coffee in while you wait for the charging."</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/polestar_5_side.jpg?itok=SGIT9BO0" width="900" /></p>
<p>This technology, called extreme fast-charging (XFC), is a collaboration between Polestar and StoreDot, a charging company that Polestar has invested in.</p>
<p>StoreDot pioneered XFC initially on a mobile phone that could be fully charged in five minutes. XFC can be integrated into existing battery technology and doesn&#039;t require “a battery pack design revolution”, according to Polestar.</p>
<p>Polestar and StoreDot successfully demonstrated it on a full-sized working 5 prototype last year.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s a game-changer as it uses traditional lithium ion and then adapts it for fast charging," StoreDot CEO Doron Myersdorf told Autocar previously.</p>
<p>StoreDot manufactures the lithium ion pouch cells with silicon anodes but is investigating using it on hard-case prismatic cells too.</p>
<p>Polestar has already confirmed a power output for the 5 of 874bhp and 663lb ft of torque from its twin electric motors, which provide four-wheel drive. The more powerful rear motor produces 604bhp alone.</p>
<p>The 5 is an evolution of 2020&#039;s imposing Precept concept. Only the concept&#039;s most outlandish features – its heavily accentuated side creases, ultra-slim digital wing mirrors, reverse-opening rear doors and oversized alloy wheels – have been casualties of the homologation process.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/polestar_5_rear_three_quarter_0.jpg?itok=XpmECzvE" width="900" /></p>
<p>Polestar has also said its flagship <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric car</a> will tout “supercar levels” of body stiffness from the all-new platform, which will also be the lightest in its class.</p>
<p>The 5’s body is constructed chiefly from bonded aluminium, with other sections made from hot-formed, cold-formed, die-cast and extruded aluminium.</p>
<p>It’s this bonded aluminium construction that affords the car “supercar levels of torsional stiffness, which is fundamental to class-leading ride and handling dynamics”, said Polestar UK chief engineer Dave Kane.</p>
<p>The battery pack, the size of which hasn&#039;t yet been specified, is then integrated into the platform.</p>
<p>UK R&D boss Pete Allen added that a goal for the 5 is to “deliver best-in-class levels of dynamics and that starts with the structure”. To that end, the 5’s body offers “carbonfibre levels of torsional stiffness, like a two-door sports model”.</p>
<p>The Taycan is an obvious rival to the 5 and Polestar is understood to have one at its MIRA facility for benchmarking purposes. However, the Swedish manufacturer wants to create a car with more everyday compliance and a rounded edge, rather than chasing truly sports car-like handling.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/polestar_5_front.jpg?itok=aNPhCQ6A" width="900" /></p>
<p>“It needs to be engaging but also comfortable,” said Steve Swift, director of vehicle engineering. “We can push the car in a dynamic direction or a comfort direction without totally sacrificing one or the other.”</p>
<p>Further developments include motorsport-derived underbody aerodynamics and a slippery body shape.</p>
<p>“It’s an extremely low car [for an electric car],” said Allen. “Not as low as an internal- combustion-engine car but close, and they don’t have batteries underneath. That has been a particular challenge.”</p>
<p>Much of the engineering work on the 5 is being done with future Polestar products in mind. There’s “a lot of scalability” in the new platform, said Swift. “You start with a car first, then look at the products in other spaces, then how many of those spaces we can play in while designing it once. It’s part of the future, definitely.”</p>
<p>The 6 will be the second model to be built on the new architecture, and the two models will be built alongside one another in the same factory from 2026, when the 6 launches a year after the 5 arrives.</p>
<h2>First ride: Polestar 5 prototype review</h2>
<p>As a means of getting familiar with an all-new car, passenger rides are a bit of a blunt instrument. But sometimes the car in question does something so novel, and does it so effortlessly, that it doesn’t matter which seat you’re sitting in because the cat’s just as far out of the bag. </p>
<p>This is what happens during our passenger ride in a leggy, pre-production Polestar 5 on the Dunlop dry handling circuit at the MIRA proving ground – a circuit Autocar road testers know quite well because it’s where we set the magazine’s benchmarking lap times.</p>
<p>After some chit-chat about the Porsche Taycan-rivalling 5 being "an opportunity to mature the Polestar brand" in dynamic terms, the project’s principal vehicle dynamics engineer – 31-year-old Chris Baguley – <span>without warning </span>delicately backs its low, camouflaged form into one of the course’s two inviting hairpin bends, unsticks the back axle with an injection of torque and then rides out an enormous, graceful powerslide.</p>
<p>To onlookers, the sight would be akin to what you’d get if you parsed a fully lit <a href="/car-news/features/used-car-hero-revisiting-e39-bmw-m5">&#039;E39&#039; BMW M5</a> through Syd Mead’s imagination. More to the point, it’s the kind of antic that flies in the face of the controlled but po-faced dynamic identity Polestar has so far shown with its electric saloons and crossovers.</p>
<p><img alt="Polestar 5 prototype front quarter static" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/polestar-5-prototype-2023-front-left-quarter-static.jpg?itok=x1kto_LR" /></p>
<p>Getting something so rippling with torque, and with such a long wheelbase, to behave like this isn’t hard, but what’s surprising – and noticeable even from the passenger seat – is the sense of finesse. Pedigree, even.</p>
<p>Perhaps this isn’t too surprising, either, given the 5 has been developed not from an existing <a href="/car-review/volvo">Volvo</a> platform at Polestar HQ in Gothenburg, or in China, where it’ll be assembled. Instead, it’s being brought to life here at MIRA, from scratch, by a predominantly British team of engineers with backgrounds at <a href="/car-review/lotus">Lotus</a> and <a href="/car-review/mclaren">McLaren</a>, among other AAA-grade handling schools – and it shows.</p>
<p>The way the 5’s tail moves out of line then slips back in is, sorry for the cliché, buttery. This purely rear-driven example also seems the forgiving sort. Baguley can boot it mid-corner, when we’re already very sideways, and on its bespoke Michelins the 5 – sustaining yaw all the way – punches out of medium-speed bends at a rate you’d be happy even were you not frittering drive away by showboating. The 5 feels hooked up, composed, and on the way into bends resists understeer better than expected.</p>
<p>Concrete technical details about the 5 are currently scarce and will remain so until we’re closer to the car’s launch. However, beyond a <a href="/car-review/bmw">BMW</a> M-car-esque penchant for oversteer, our passenger ride unearths some intriguing elements as well as giving a fair glimpse of the car’s broader character. One unexpected thing is that the 5 will ride on a passive suspension set-up – no, no air springs here, or even selectable modes.</p>
<p>This feels like a big call for a car with what will surely be a six-figure price, though on the far from smooth Dunlop circuit, the 5 does show a natural poise with good suppleness. Potholes and poor roads will be harder to subdue.</p>
<p><img alt="Polestar 5 prototype rear quarter static" class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/polestar-5-prototype-2023-rear-quarter-static.jpg?itok=YSnUFQKZ" /></p>
<p>Next up is rear passenger space, which is enormous. Honestly, in the back the Polestar makes the Taycan feel like a <a href="/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-buying-guide-volkswagen-lupo-gti">Volkswagen Lupo</a>, and not just in terms of leg room but also in terms of atmosphere. The glass canopy is vast and visibility through the front of the cabin, then out of the massively raked windscreen, is excellent.</p>
<p>If – if – the car’s ride quality at MIRA translates onto public roads and is matched with fine isolation (at MIRA the pared-back cabin of our development car is predictably whiney and roar-y at speed) the 5 will be a class act. Special mention also goes to the low dash scuttle: up front there’s just a touch of supercar to the ambience.</p>
<p>I just hope the steering is up to the mark. In this area, Polestar’s efforts so far have been lacklustre, but clearly the 5 is like no other Polestar so far.</p>
<p>Will it really stand up to the outstanding Taycan? On this evidence, quite possibly. The mechanical recipe is disarmingly simple – no air springs, or rear steering, no active anti-roll bars, and in this case just one driven axle – but clearly it’s all very deftly tuned. There’s something appealingly old-school about this method, though the aesthetic will be anything but.</p>
<p>As Baguley puts it: "We want to challenge the Taycan in this space – to do something differently and prove that a bit of a refresh is not always a bad thing."</p>

<p>Peugeot has launched a new version of the <a href="/car-review/peugeot/208">208</a> that cuts the supermini’s starting price from £24,645 to £19,995.</p>
<p>Named the 208 Style, it&#039;s available only with a turbocharged 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine that sends 99bhp to the front wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox.</p>
<p>It&#039;s visually distinguished from its more expensive siblings by a colour-contrasting black grille and steel wheels fitted with plastic trims.</p>
<p>Inside, it gets black and grey cloth seats with orange stitching, rather than cloth and faux leather, and retains the other 208 variants’ 10in infotainment touchscreen.</p>
<p>The tweaks mean the 208 now joins a small group of new cars available in the UK with a list price of less than £20,000. This includes the <a href="/car-review/citroen/c3">Citroën C3</a> (£18,305), <a href="/car-review/dacia/sandero">Dacia Sandero</a> (£14,715) and the <a href="/car-review/vauxhall/corsa">Vauxhall Corsa</a> (£17,975).</p>
<p>Deliveries will begin this summer.</p>
<p>As well as revealing the Style, Peugeot has boosted the output of the 208 Hybrid. The entry-level version has been uprated from 99bhp to 108bhp, while the 134bhp version has been boosted to 143bhp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the electric <a href="/car-review/peugeot/e-208">e-208</a> has gained the option of vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality, allowing its battery to power external devices. This is available for £400 extra on the 51kWh version.</p>

<p>Volvo is aiming for a change of gear on its path towards electrification with this week’s road test subject. The <strong>Volvo EX30</strong> is a small car that, it’s hoped, can have a big impact on Gothenburg’s sales mix.</p>
<p>Its maker is already aiming for half of its global sales to be of all-electric models by 2025, and to be selling BEVs exclusively by 2030. In order to hit those marks, however, Volvo needs affordable electric models like this – but, moreover, it needs people to buy them in greater numbers than they are currently. </p>
<p>You wonder, in fact, if and when brands like <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo">Volvo</a> might start rolling back on – or, at least, tempering slightly – ambitious electrification claims like these. The penetration of EVs, in many western markets including the UK, is stuck at between 15% and 25%, and not for the want of an increasing number of more affordable all-electric options. </p>
<p>So the commercial challenge facing this car looks significant. For the next couple of thousand words, however, we will concern ourselves with whether the Volvo EX30 is the kind of electric car that deserves to drive adoption, and ultimately to succeed, in the first place. </p>
<p>It is the first of a new breed of Volvos for more reasons than one: not just because it is the smallest in decades (since the Volvo-DAF 300 series of the 1970s, in fact), nor because it is the first Volvo designed exclusively for electric power (not counting the XC40-derived C40 crossover-coupé), but also because it’s based on an all-new platform developed fully in the firm’s current, Geely-controlled corporate era.</p>

<p>The EX30 model range runs from a little under £34k to a little over £44k, before options. The car can be had with a 51kWh or 69kWh drive battery, and either one primary rearmounted drive motor or one per axle. Volvo offers two de facto model trim levels, Plus and Ultra.</p>
<p>On a mid-level single-motor car, the former comes with 11kW AC charging, 19in alloy wheels and manual seat adjustment. Stumping up for the latter gets you 22kW three-phase charging potential, 20in wheels, a panoramic glass roof and electric seat adjustment.</p>
<p>Single motor cars are rear-wheel drive, whereas twin motor cars are four-wheel drive.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-02-panning.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 02 panning" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 02 panning" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volvo has certainly gone small with this car by its own standards, without defying compact EV class norms. The EX30, as its model nomenclature suggests, is an all-electric compact SUV. It’s more than 200mm shorter than Gothenburg’s next-smallest model, and shorter at the kerb also than either the Ford Focus-based <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars-used-car-buying-guides/used-car-buying-guide-volvo-c30">Volvo C30</a> (of 2006) or the Volvo 480 (of 1986) hatchbacks were, although it has a five-door hatchback body. Relative to its modern rivals, however, it’s not all that small (a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/avenger-electric">Jeep Avenger Electric</a> is almost 200mm shorter).</p>
<p>For now, it is offered in what we might call a moderately high-riding bodystyle only, although a Cross Country version is slated to bring extra ground clearance later in 2024. </p>
<p>It is the first Volvo to be built on the Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) developed by Geely for new-generation electric cars, and which – in slightly differing technical guises, at least – has already been deployed on cars as different as the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lotus/eletre">Lotus Eletre</a>, the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/polestar/4">Polestar 4</a> and the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/smart/1">Smart #1</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/smart/3">#3</a>. </p>
<p>SEA is more like a family of platforms than one skateboard-style chassis, insists Geely. On the EX30, it confers a steel chassis, over which is laid a body made of a mix of aluminium, steel and plastic, of which nearly 60% (by volume) is recycled. Around the interior, about one-fifth of the car’s mouldings are likewise recycled, and much of its upholstery is made of recycled polyester or denim. As a result of all of the above, claims Volvo, the EX30 has the lowest ‘life-cycle carbon emissions’ (the combined total of what is associated with its manufacture and its use) of any car the company has ever made – and half that of a petrol-powered XC40.</p>
<p>Volvo is hoping that those kinds of sustainability qualifications will attract younger, climate-conscious buyers – but the ethical argument isn’t all that it’s offering. Like plenty of its competitors, the EX30 has a primary drive motor carried over the rear wheels, which provides up to 268bhp and 253lb ft. That fulsome power output is enough to put our 1779kg-as-tested Single Motor Extended Range Plus model (Volkswagen ID 3 58kWh – 1757kg, Peugeot e-2008 GT – 1638kg) on close terms with a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i5">BMW i5 eDrive40</a> for power-to-weight ratio. </p>
<p>For those who want even more, there’s also a twin-motor Performance Plus version with a supplementary 154bhp drive motor of the same type on the front axle, which makes it four-wheel drive. The motors combine to 423bhp and the 0-62mph sprint takes just 3.6sec (making it the quickest-accelerating Volvo production model yet made).</p>
<p>Power storage comes from a choice of drive batteries: a lithium-iron-phosphate unit of 49kWh of usable capacity, or a nickel-manganese-cobalt one of 64kWh in Extended Range or Twin Motor cars (as fitted). The latter is good for up to 296 miles of WLTP range – a figure in the upper reaches of the affordable electric car class.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/ex30sche.jpg?itok=h1c-OSEj" width="900" /></p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-09-interior.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 09 interior" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 09 interior" /></p>
<div>
<p>It’s a tribute to the skill of Volvo’s interior designers to have made the cabin of the EX30 such a neat, tactile and appealing place to be. It 145mm 15mm Centre uses plenty of recycled materials, yet its mouldings and trims feel inviting, solid to the touch, and both interesting and alternative.</p>
<p>And then you start to notice what’s missing. In front of you is neither a driver’s instrument binnacle nor a head-up display. The car’s electric window switches are on the centre console to your left, and so, immediately to your right, the door console contains neither audio speakers nor any switchgear.</p>
<p>Clever, centrally mounted, drawerstyle cupholders (which slide out from under the centre armrest) and a small, centrally mounted glovebox ahead of them make so much of the fascia and surrounding cabin layout symmetrical, so as not to add manufacturing complexity for right- or left-hand drive.</p>
<p>There is little in the way of a lower dashboard, with extra storage available instead in a shallow covered floor bin ahead of the centre console. Above that, the car’s 12.3in, portrait-oriented touchscreen infotainment system sits, carrying a simplified digital instrumentation panel at its uppermost edge, and everything else – from trip computer data to navigation mapping, audio, telephony and climate controls, and so many secondary controls for things like foglights, wiper control and ADAS systems – accessible below. </p>
<p>Suffice to say, this is a pretty bold ergonomic rethink – and, in our book, a problematic one. Although the steering column does have physical stalks for transmission control (right) and main beam/turn indicators/windscreen washers (left), and there are also a few physical switches on the steering wheel spokes, that’s still a lot for one ‘centralised’ touchscreen console to manage.</p>
<p>It falls down for top-level accessibility of key functions – and seriously enough to constitute a significant drivability problem. It takes too many individual interactions to deactivate the driver monitoring or speed limit alarm systems, for example – and, without a tactile physical cursor controller, diverts too much of your attention from the road in the process. </p>
<p>Volvo claims that an over-the-air software update for the infotainment home screen, due later this year, can address the problem, and well it may. Still, in the main, you might expect a safety-centred Volvo to be quite a lot simpler and easier to operate, and much more reassuring than distracting to drive, than this – not to say more practical (neither second row nor boot space deserves credit in a class of significantly more practical options).</p>
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/volvo-ex30-review-2024-17-infotainment_0.jpg?itok=TSF_w42p" width="900" /></p>
<p>Volvo’s 12.3in infotainment system for the EX30 is powered by Google Automotive software, but the company has promised wireless mirroring with Apple and Android handsets since the car’s debut. It was disappointing to find on our test car that Apple compatibility has so far been omitted (the same thing happened with the Polestar 2 when new), although Volvo  claims it will be added via an over-the-air software update. </p>
<p>Top-level navigability for the system lacks the user configurability of rival systems, and so your most accessed functions can remain hidden behind layers of menus. Volvo allows some adaptation of the home screen but not of shortcut toolbars, which would make a big difference. As it is, controls for functions that directly affect the car’s drivability (and that reset to ‘on’ automatically) simply aren’t accessible enough. </p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-24-charging-port.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 24 charging port" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 24 charging port" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>Even the single-motor EX30 has a fairly mature and sophisticated but brisk and assertive-feeling drive. It takes off from rest without abruptness and with plenty of traction and composure but with quickly gathering potency, and needed just 5.7sec to hit 60mph from rest on a chilly but dry test day, and 5.1sec to cover 30-70mph (<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/kia/niro-ev">Kia Niro EV</a> – 6.9sec and 5.6sec respectively). </p>
<p>But before you can really enjoy that linear, quiet, amply responsive performance, you must first learn to temper the car’s propensity to distract and annoy. The driver monitoring system, in cahoots with its centralised instrumentation and infotainment screen, is the chief culprit here.</p>
<p>Leave the former activated and it will castigate you for glancing at the instrument display (which should, in our view, be positioned closer to your natural line of sight anyway) for more than two or three seconds – or, for that matter, in the rear-view mirror, or out of the driver’s side window. And so, for our testers, disabling the driver monitoring (to be done every time you ‘cycle the ignition’, but best before you set off) was a must in order to avoid being distracted interminably while at the wheel (see ‘Assisted driving&#039; below). </p>
<p>Once you have done that, the EX30 is entirely pleasant, and has all of the performance it needs, and then some. It is quick enough, by some margin, to make the dual-motor car seem an expensive irrelevance; has torque spread widely enough as to feel authoritative even at motorway speeds; and – at least here – is uncomplicated to drive. </p>
<p>There are no manual energy regeneration controls, no drive modes and no ‘B’ or one-pedal powertrain settings. The car tends to conserve momentum rather than regenerating on a trailing throttle, then, although the initial ‘tip in’ brake pedal travel works well enough to blend in motor scavenging effectively. EV regulars might prefer more manual control over the powertrain’s energy management, but most should approve of the simplicity afforded here.</p>
<h2>Assisted driving</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/volvo-ex30-review-2024-18-infotinament_0.jpg?itok=ukQ_b-hy" width="900" /></p>
<p>An unholy alliance of problems conspire to create the EX30’s ability to distract and frustrate you while driving. If you do nothing to disable it, the driver monitoring system will alert you continually once your gaze has been diverted from the road for five seconds or more. Glancing at the central speedo doesn’t take that long, although dialling up and consulting trip computer information on the infotainment system can, and other processes are even more involved. </p>
<p>The lane departure warning system isn’t too intrusive, though it’s best deactivated on winding roads. Pilot Assist lane keeping is activated separately, and works well on motorways, without putting in so much input as to encourage the driver to disengage entirely. The speed limit alert warning is more insistent, less progressive and therefore more irritating than other manufacturers’ systems, but you can configure a multifunction button on the steering wheel to deactivate it directly.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-26-rear-cornering.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 26 rear cornering" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 26 rear cornering" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volvo is so far from the company it was 25 years ago as to be almost beyond recognition, and even if it weren’t, you would expect any small, youthfully targeted model from the firm to be flavoured with a little bit of agility and fun factor – just as the EX30 is, at least in part.</p>
<p>All that said, this isn’t a car that forces the point. It has fairly light, filtered-feeling, only moderately pacy steering, doesn’t feign the kind of darting directional energy that some small cars have, and is always intuitive to handle.</p>
<p>But even so, it does show some clear signs of keenness to get down the road. Lateral grip level and cornering body control are both quite good for a crossover vehicle. The car turns in in settled fashion but is then ready to resist roll, work all four contact patches and hold a tight line with decent determination.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make its front axle feel at all lightly loaded when doing so (note the 48:52 front-to-rear weight distribution); it doesn’t take on precautionary steady-state understeer; and it isn’t saddled with intrusive stability control interventions as a gesture towards safety-first stability.</p>
<p>The car isn’t quite fun. There’s a lack of liveliness, and a surfeit of calmness and measure, about the EX30’s steering and chassis response that leaves it some way off from fully engaging and entertaining its driver like, say, a Cupra Born can. But it has a certain pleasing tenacity to it.</p>
<h2>Comfort and isolation</h2>
<p>The EX30’s driver’s seat presents at a fairly hatchback-typical height and, while it isn’t large or enveloping, it is certainly comfortable, with plenty of surrounding space in the front row. Adjustability of the cushion and squab is a little limited in scope, but most testers found a good, comfortable driving position anyway. Visibility is good to the front and sides, and good enough rearwards and over-shoulder.</p>
<p>Our decibel meter recorded 63dBA and 66dBA during 50mph and 70mph cruising respectively: better outright isolation, in one case or other, than some direct electric rivals have demonstrated of late, but not outstanding. </p>
<p>The car’s slightly reactive, oddly pitchy A- and B-road ride is a bigger dynamic obstacle to its ‘premium’ credentials, however. Here, the weight of it does seem to be a factor, as does its longer-travel suspension. It feels a little as if the chassis is tuned to use its driven, motor-laden rear axle as some kind of motion damper for the rest of the chassis, which rises and falls over the rear wheels gently but consistently over bumpier roads. It’s never permitted to get out of control but seldom seems fully controlled either, and certainly isn’t a positive influence on wider comfort levels.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-01-front-cornering_1.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 01 front cornering 1" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 01 front cornering 1" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volvo claims to have done much to drive down total cost of ownership for EX30 customers – and in offering this car from less than £34,000 in its simplest, shortest-range specification, it may catch plenty of interested glances.</p>
<p>Although it has recently bolstered personal finance offers a little, however, it isn’t yet competing with the 0% deals or bigger manufacturer contributions that rivals are now resorting to in order to motivate EV buyers, and so you will be likely to find the EX30 a good deal pricier on monthly rates than many of its competitors.</p>
<p>It is, however, quite well equipped. Our mid-spec Single Motor Extended Range Plus test car came with piloted (adaptive) cruise control and a full suite of Volvo safety systems, as standard, as well as wireless device charging, premium audio, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. </p>
<p>The car disappointed in our efficiency and range tests, averaging less than three miles per kWh over the full course of our test and only 2.6mpkWh during 70mph cruising. While it was tested in fairly chilly temperatures, our test car did feature a heat pump as standard.</p>
<p>In lower-speed motoring it got much closer to Volvo’s official efficiency claims, but in mixed use it was a car that might do only 180 miles on a charge, when key rivals will manage 25-40% better.</p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volvo-ex30-review-2024-28-front-static.jpg" width="1600" height="1066" alt="volvo ex30 review 2024 28 front static" title="volvo ex30 review 2024 28 front static" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volvo, like every car maker, should reserve the right to do things differently when it enters new market segments, but it doesn’t have the right to do things badly. Not, at least, without censure.</p>
<p>Although it’s described as a small SUV, what the EX30 amounts to is more like a slightly high-riding but only averagely well-packaged hatchback. Apparently defined rather too much in opposition to the rest of the Volvo range – ‘the small one, so what does it matter if it’s not practical?’ – rather than with close reference to compact EV rivals, it is only averagely well packaged and versatile.</p>
<p>The car’s unusually irrational positioning extends from there to include stronger performance than it really needs (especially in the case of the twin-motor version) but underwhelming efficiency and range, and a slightly poorly resolved ride.</p>
<p>However, it also takes in a cabin layout and digital control concept that feel a little sanctimonious in their devotion to certain sustainability and safety ideals – but which, in practice, admit much greater compromises on ease of operation and driver distraction than a Volvo really should.</p>

<div>
<p>With the <strong>Kia Niro</strong>, the Korean company beat most of its rivals to the wildly popular segment of <a href="/car-news/best-cars/best-small-suvs">small SUVs</a> – and did so with reasonably priced hybrid options and an <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric car</a> with a long range.</p>
<p>And that highlights something quite unusual about this car: there has always been a Niro Hybrid, a Niro Plug-in Hybrid and a <a href="/car-review/kia/niro-ev">Kia Niro EV</a>. </p>
<p>Accommodating both combustion engines and big battery packs on the same platform can lead to an unhappy compromise, but the original <a href="/car-review/kia/niro-2016-2022">Niro (2016-2022)</a> managed to be both a convincing hybrid and an impressive EV when it came out, and this second-generation model aims to do the same.</p>
<p>With this Mk2 Niro, though, <a href="/car-review/kia">Kia</a> has more competition to be worried about, with a whole glut of rivals with all kinds of electrified powertrains. New arrivals in the class seem to arrive every week, and in the case of Kia itself it has since launched another similarly sized electric car to the Niro EV just two years after our test subject was launched in the shape of the<a href="/car-review/kia/ev3"> Kia EV3</a>. Progress is fast in the compact crossover world. </p>
<p>For now, the Niro EV is the biggest seller in the range, with the hybrid close behind it. The PHEV sells in tiny numbers. It’s the two hybrid versions that are the subject of this review.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/02a-kia-niro-hev-fd-2022-rear-action.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="02a Kia Niro HEV FD 2022 rear action" title="02a Kia Niro HEV FD 2022 rear action" /></p>
<div>
<p>The new Niro sits on a new platform, the second-generation K3 platform also found beneath the <a href="/car-review/hyundai/i30">Hyundai i30</a>, and there are even bigger changes in its design.</p>
<p>The old Niro was more butch MPV than crossover, whereas the new one has a more confident SUV stance and follows the <a href="/car-review/kia/ev6">Kia EV6</a> and <a href="/car-review/kia/sportage">Kia Sportage</a> in adopting an aggressive, alien-like face.</p>
<p>Kia&#039;s &#039;tiger nose&#039; grille remains in a way but forfeits its original purpose as an air intake, becoming more of a decorative monobrow.</p>
<p>The whole car has grown, too, becoming 65mm longer and 20mm wider. Whether that’s a good thing on crowded roads is one thing, but it certainly benefits the car’s stance and interior space. And despite the growth spurt, Kia has managed to avoid making the Niro any heavier.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/11-kia-niro-hev-2-fd-2022-base-model-dashboard_1.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="11 kia niro hev 2 fd 2022 base model dashboard" title="11 kia niro hev 2 fd 2022 base model dashboard" /></p>
<div>
<p>The big leap on from the old Niro is in the interior ambience. It emphasises the EV6 family connection with fused twin screens set into a single display, wildly swooping lines and that curious two-spoke steering wheel.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that the aesthetic actually works better on the Niro. Where the EV6 and Sportage have a bit too much shiny black plastic and scratchy surfaces for their price point, those cheaper materials sit more comfortably in the more affordable Niro. In fact, the designers have seized the opportunity to introduce some creative touches.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual elephant-skin texturing, they’ve gone for a stone-like surface on the plastic door and dash panels, and there are flashes of colour to keep it all light. The trim panels are plastic but in the higher trim levels, they look like tarnished brass. The seats and headlining use recycled materials and leather isn&#039;t an option.</p>
<p>Amid all the style, function hasn’t been forgotten: there are plenty of easy buttons and switches. Kia’s switchable dual-purpose touchbar for the ventilation and the infotainment shortcuts is a little fiddly, but we’ve seen far worse solutions.</p>
<p>The Niro has Kia’s standard touchscreen infotainment system, which requires a cable for <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay">Apple Carplay</a> and <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto">Android Auto</a> but is otherwise easy to use.</p>
<p>Front and rear seats are comfy and supportive and the lofty driving position will be appreciated by SUV buyers, but taller drivers will wish for some more reach adjustment in the steering.</p>
<p>The back seat is now a realistic proposition for adults and, unlike in the <a href="/car-review/honda/hr-v">Honda HR-V</a>, that’s not to the detriment of boot space.</p>
<p>At 451 litres, the boot of the hybrid is a good deal bigger than what you get in the HR-V or the <a href="/car-review/toyota/c-hr">Toyota C-HR</a> but slightly smaller than in the <a href="/car-review/renault/arkana">Renault Arkana</a>. The hybrid battery naturally robs space compared with pure-petrol rivals.</p>
<p>The PHEV loses the underfloor boot space of the hybrid and EV and is therefore smaller still, but its 348 litres of luggage capacity takes the form of a nice, squared-off boot that will house a chunky buggy or a sizeable dog with relative ease.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/22-kia-niro-hev-fd-2022-town_1.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="22 kia niro hev fd 2022 town" title="22 kia niro hev fd 2022 town" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>Both the hybrid system and the PHEV system are based around a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox driving the front wheels.</p>
<p>Electric assistance comes from a 1.32kWh battery and a 43bhp electric motor in the case of the hybrid or an 11.1kWh battery and an 83bhp electric motor in the PHEV.</p>
<p>The hybrid produces a combined 127bhp and the PHEV a combined 168bhp.</p>
<p>In the PHEV, the battery is up from 8.9kWh previously, so its official electric-only range now extends as far as 40 miles.</p>
<p>A Type 2 socket on the flank of the PHEV will suck up enough electricity for a flat to full battery in around 2.5 hours from a standard home wallbox.</p>
<p>From a standstill to about 40mph, the electric motor makes the Niro hybrid feel pleasantly torquey. At higher speeds, the engine has to work harder. It means the hybrid isn&#039;t exactly fast, but it&#039;s adequate, and Kia has done a good job keeping the engine noise out of the cabin. The only time the engine feels slightly coarse is when it unexpectedly has to fire up, especially from cold.</p>
<p>As before, you get two driving modes: Eco and Sport. The old Niro suffered from overly languid throttle calibration in Eco mode, but that has been addressed now.</p>
<p>Apart from having no reverse gear (that is taken care of by the electric motor), the dual-clutch gearbox is utterly conventional. In this case, there’s nothing wrong with that. </p>
<p>Having six gears to cycle through means it can&#039;t replicate the perfect smoothness in the HR-V and C-HR, but it does feel more direct and natural, both compared to its Japanese rivals and Renault&#039;s E-Tech solution.</p>
<p>If you desire a dynamic powertrain with instant responses, a mild-hybrid or pure-petrol alternative is still a better bet, because the Niro hybrid can be slow to downshift when you demand more power.</p>
<p>The Niro PHEV is a predictably pleasant and refined way to get about. There’s very little whine from the motor as you set off, which you can do with greater urgency than you might expect, given the moderately slovenly 0-62mph time of 9.6sec.</p>
<p>There’s quite a noticeable thrum as the petrol engine kicks in, but vibration is kept to a minimum and the engine stays quiet so long as you don’t rev it too hard.</p>
<p>Which you’re not terribly inclined to do, because, in contrast to the hybrid version, the engine sounds coarse and noisy in its PHEV application, without delivering much recompense in acceleration.  </p>
<p>And even without the fun deterrent that this underwhelming 1.6-litre engine in this installation undoubtedly is, this simply isn’t a car that encourages spirited driving.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/21-kia-niro-hev-fd-2022-rear-track_1.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="21 kia niro hev fd 2022 rear track" title="21 kia niro hev fd 2022 rear track" /></p>
<div>
<p>Given that all Niros use the same platform and look largely identical, you would expect them to feel broadly similar to drive. However, that isn&#039;t the case at all, as we’ve already seen in the performance section.</p>
<p>Whereas the new Niro EV is genuinely engaging, thanks to feelsome steering and a keen front end, the hybrid just handles securely but uninspiringly. There&#039;s more body roll and the steering is quite light and mostly mute.</p>
<p>It&#039;s the same story for comfort: even on the smallest wheels, the hybrid&#039;s suspension can crash through potholes where the EV would soften off the edges.</p>
<p>Compared with other hybrid crossovers, the Niro&#039;s ride is absolutely fine, however, and much improved over the old car.</p>
<p>Acoustic refinement isn’t the Niro’s strong point. Slightly more road roar, suspension noise and wind whistle filter through into the cabin than in rivals – but, as with the ride, it’s nothing you wouldn’t quickly get used to.</p>
<p>The Niro PHEV is comfortable and relaxed, which is far more relevant to its likely use. Our high-spec test car came on 18in alloy wheels that bring a slightly chatty ride around town, but it’s never intrusive enough to bother you, and it settles nicely at higher speeds.</p>
<p>It has a Sport mode that brings heavier steering, wakes the petrol engine and turns the steering-wheel-mounted paddles (which you more commonly use to toggle through the brake regen modes) into gearshift paddles. But even with that in action, the steering still feels very anodyne – nicely weighted and predictable for everyday driving but never engaging.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Niro PHEV is at its best when you’re at a steady gait, enjoying the confident, easy-going progress. It’s not a car you buy for its dynamic effervescence, certainly, but it is one that you can find satisfaction in driving – especially when you’re enjoying the hushed, seamless ebb and flow of EV mode.</p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/01-kia-niro-hev-fd-2022-front-track.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="01 Kia Niro HEV FD 2022 Front track" title="01 Kia Niro HEV FD 2022 Front track" /></p>
<div>
<p>Both the hybrid and PHEV versions of the Niro are available in three different trim levels: 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>The hybrid starts from just over £30,000 and the PHEV from just over £35,000. </p>
<p>As with all Kias, options are typically limited to paint colours in favour of the trim levels bundling in extra equipment as you walk up through them to the point where range-topping 4 models are better equipped than many a premium rival.</p>
<p>Whatever the version, a seven-year/100,000-mile warranty is included. </p>
<p>The Niro hybrid has seriously impressive fuel economy. On the motorway, it will average well over 60mpg with ease, and even if you cane it on some back roads, it refuses to dip under 40mpg. In mixed usage, MPG figures in the high 50s ought to be realistic.</p>
<p>Kia and <a href="/car-review/hyundai">Hyundai</a> used to lag behind <a href="/car-review/toyota">Toyota</a> when it came to the efficiency of their powertrains, but they appear to have closed that gap now.</p>
<p>Company car drivers will be most interested in the PHEV because of the asscociated low BIk costs. In our real-world testing we found the electric range to be around 30 miles. </p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/04-kia-niro-hev-4-fd-2022-rear-track_1.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="04 kia niro hev 4 fd 2022 rear track" title="04 kia niro hev 4 fd 2022 rear track" /></p>
<div>
<p>The Niro remains at its best as an all-electric car: within the entire range, the Niro EV is the one we would recommend. However, that car itself has already been bettered by the new Kia EV3, meaning it might not be around for long, leaving the Niro’s future as a hybrid-only model.</p>
<p>Buyers of the hybrids will find a pleasant car that’s efficient, decent if not inspiring to drive and with a comfortable, well-equipped interior. It’s the kind of car that doesn’t stand out in any particular area while not falling obviously short anywhere either.</p>
<p>The Niro has migrated into a more desirable bodyshape and become a slightly larger car while still retaining a compact feel and fully making use of its increased exterior dimensions to the benefit of passengers and their luggage.</p>
<p>It’s the classic case of a car that you would buy with your head more than your heart. Yet you can do so without regret, as you will get to enjoy another modern, relevant Kia that has plenty of objective qualities. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/opel-mokka-gse-teaser.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Opel Mokka GSe teaser" title="Opel Mokka GSe teaser" /><figcaption>Opel Mokka GSe teaser</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>Vauxhall is readying a hot new GSe version of its <a href="/car-review/vauxhall/mokka-electric">Mokka crossover</a> as it transitions the nascent performance-focused sub-brand to offering solely <a href="/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars">electric cars</a>.</p>
<p>The company has yet to confirm any details, but the new model made an appearance in a preview video posted to social media by CEO Florian Huettl announcing that it will ditch models with combustion engines such as the previous <a href="/car-review/vauxhall/astra">Astra GSe</a>.</p>
<p>The Mokka is most likely to employ the same single-motor set-up used in the related <a href="/car-review/abarth/600e">Abarth 600e</a>, <a href="/car-review/alfa-romeo/junior">Alfa Romeo Junior Veloce</a> and <a href="/car-news/new-cars/lancia-previews-ypsilon-hf-hot-hatch-and-confirms-rallying-return">Lancia Ypsilon HF</a>. This is offered with outputs of 235bhp and 278bhp, which, in the 600e, yield 0-62mph times of 6.2sec and 5.9sec respectively. All three hot EVs are also fitted with limited-slip differentials to help them put that power to the Tarmac.</p>
<p>As well as an uplift in power, Huettl suggested that the Mokka GSe will be more greatly differentiated from the cooking version in dynamic terms than was the case for the Astra GSe. He said the performance brand now represents characteristics such as “great grip and g-forces” and “sweat”, but also “sliding through S-curves”.</p>
<p>The preview video implies the new GSe will be more clearly differentiated in styling terms too. The Mokka featured in it sports a rally-style roof scoop. It’s possible that this is an element reserved purely for a concept previewing an eventual production car, however.</p>
<p>In addition to the Mokka GSe, Huettl hinted that there will be further news on more electric Vauxhalls. He said: “[GSe] is also a promise that [Vauxhall’s] electric future will not be driven by compromise. There is more to come in 2025 – we are just getting started.”</p>
<p>It is possible that this is a hint at a big reveal at September&#039;s <a href="/topics/motor-shows/munich-motor-show">Munich motor show</a> – home turf for Vauxhall twin brand Opel – although nothing has yet been made official.</p>

<p>Culmination is one of those words that can be used in subtly different ways. We will ignore its archaic use (the reaching of the meridian by a celestial body) and delve straight into its two most popular meanings today. </p>
<p>One definition is the highest point of something, especially as attained after a long time. The other is the point at which something ends, having developed until it reaches this point.</p>
<p>Subtle differences, then. It can mean best, it can mean last and it can mean a mixture of the two, as in the example we’re considering here.</p>
<p>Next year, this version of the <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mazda/mx-5">Mazda MX-5</a> (the ‘ND’ for <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mazda">Mazda</a> aficionados) will have been on sale for a decade. Ten whole years for one model. </p>
<p>During its lifetime, it has gone through subtle changes and upgrades before culminating in this Homura-spec car. It’s basically all the bells and whistles, and what I think on paper is the best model.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-26-1600x1067-1e08e08c-7c10-4835-9e5e-ee5484b356de.jpg?itok=JOIrmii8" width="900" /></p>
<p>Up front, it gets the 181bhp 2.0-litre engine. Round the back is the simple, lightweight canvas roof – not the heavy and complex metal one you get on the MX-5 RF. </p>
<p>It also has 17in BBS wheels, Recaro seats, a Bose sound system (with speakers in the headrests), Bilstein dampers, a limited-slip differential, Brembo brake calipers and a track mode. That’s the first meaning of culmination well and truly done.</p>
<p>The second alludes to it being the last. Which looks like the case, at least in the pure form we know and love the MX-5. Mazda’s next sports car is set to be a 370bhp hybrid, equipped with a rotary engine that generates power for the electric motors driving the wheels.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-rotary-mazda-sports-car-planned-production">Back in 2023, Mazda CEO Masahiro Moro said</a>: “We love the MX-5 and the world loves the MX-5. We are determined in the age of electrification to keep the joy of driving which the MX-5 represents alive.”</p>
<p>‘Represents’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. Mazda’s next sports car will not be awfully like an MX-5 to me. And it will most likely not wear the MX-5 badge.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough semantics. The reason I have this MX-5 is to see if I can conceivably run one through winter as my only car. </p>
<p>The hardier among you might consider me to be a soft southerner after reading that sentence. But a few colleagues (admittedly soft southerners themselves) have told me they wouldn’t fancy running something so small, impractical and rear-wheel drive during the winter months.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-8-1600x1067-3be3c39c-ba99-465e-bfd3-1e4873c68990.jpg?itok=l0fHokQU" width="900" /></p>
<p>What do I have planned? On these pages, you will read tales of track driving at night, a few comparison tests with pretty abstract rivals and, importantly, the rather less glamorous nitty-gritty of daily use.</p>
<p>Initial thoughts? I’m not a fan of the optional matt grey paint. When <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi">Audi</a> started doing matte paint way back in 2013, it was clever in a kind of ironic way. “Look at me, spending all this money to make it look like I’ve got primer.” But since then the concept has grown tired.</p>
<p>Winter is doing the car a huge favour so far. It ’s constantly caked in mud, which hides the paint well. I love filthy cars and will fill these pages in the coming months with the dirtiest MX-5 you may ever see.</p>
<p>Other notes? This car is small. Really small. Shorter than the Mk1 MX-5 even. The first few times I parallel-parked it on my street, I actually had to try again, such was my brain’s inability to measure quite how petite it was. </p>
<p>The boot is pretty deep and useful for a car of this size, but the interior space is virtually non-existent. I recently took it to see my parents and my wife had to stash a lot of our cargo (presents, bags etc) in the front with her. I think she took it remarkably well.</p>
<p>So far I’ve been on only a few other trips in the MX-5, most of them on the motorway. And I’ve been truly dumbfounded by how at home it has felt there. An easy 40-plus MPG in the fast lane for one thing. Sixth gear is pretty long and it ’s only really pulling around 3000rpm. This is especially important to me, as my last long-termer, an <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alfa-romeo/giulia-quadrifoglio">Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio</a>, averaged 23.5mpg.</p>
<p>It’s the comfort that has surprised me most, though. It really is a pleasant place to be. When you read Bilstein dampers on the spec sheet, you think lowered and racy. But there’s a proper amount of squidge I wasn’t expecting, especially on such thin rubber. It’s not a quiet car at speed, mind you. With the Bose stereo cranked up to a volume where you can actually hear it, your passenger is fully drowned out.</p>
<p>Is this the culmination of 36 years of MX-5 production? If it comes anywhere close, I’m in for a treat – even during the depths of winter.</p>
<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/anglesey-night-track-session-2025-me-6-1600x1067-61b4a535-dfd4-4885-8681-4b0e9aac594a_1.jpg?itok=nJDa7VF4" width="900" /></p>
<p>I was invited along by Mazda to the world’s first ‘night-time track day’ in Anglesey. Yep, North Wales, in the winter. At night.  </p>
<p>The drop-top Mazda was perfect for the task; I couldn’t think of anything better to do it in. It waltzed me effortlessly from London to Wales in comfort and with surprisingly good 40mpg-plus fuel economy. </p>
<p>And then on track it was an absolute peach, flattering my driving and generally just being extremely good fun, communicative and everything you’d want in a track-day car that you also intend to drive home.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, another invite arrived. This time it was from the electro-modders at Electrogenic, wanting to know if I’d like to drive their new battery-powered <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/electrogenic/mazda-mx-5">Electrogenic Mk1 MX-5</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, please. And it was great: proper fun, with big, laugh-inducing skids, and all wrapped up in the unmistakable first-gen shell. </p>

<h2>Update 4</h2>
<p>In the office I tend to sit next to our staff writer Charlie Martin and behind Classic & Sports Car’s associate editor, Lizzie Pope. </p>
<p>Since getting my long-term MX-5 they have both bought NDs. Coincidence? Absolutely not. I should be on commission. </p>
<p>In this line of work we’re blessed with driving some of the best cars around. This section of the mag is full of interesting metal week in, week out – and the MX-5 is no exception. </p>
<p>I’ve had a great selection of long-termers in this job. But the MX-5’s mixture of low-speed fun and dependable reliability has made it my favourite. It’s a car that makes the everyday more enjoyable. </p>
<p>Some things about my MX-5 I loved immediately. The seating position and the weighting of the manual gearbox and pedals, for me, are the best in the business.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-33-1600x1067-38c0290a-c6fc-4fb2-a6c6-54cc1f9bca78.jpg?itok=VXcaxFRP" width="900" /></p>
<p>There were other aspects that I grew to love. I thought the steering was a touch light at first, but after a few weeks, and with the benefit of driving a couple of palate cleanser regular cars in between, I realised that light doesn’t have to mean uncommunicative. It just means easy. </p>
<p>Cons are harder to find. I’m not nitpicking here when I write that the infotainment short-circuits my millennial brain: it doesn’t allow me to use the touchscreen while the car is moving (there’s a rotary controller for that). </p>
<p>By the time the neurons in my brain (eventually) engage and the neurotransmitters trigger thoughts about not touching the screen, my greasy little digits are already prodding away. I have been conditioned by 20 years of touchscreen phones, and I suspect many others have. </p>
<p>Admittedly I probably am nitpicking, though, when I complain that the windscreen washer bottle is a touch small at 1.2 litres. Not ideal for hacking around in winter. </p>
<p>Finally, we’ll get round to the question we posed at the start: how easy is it to run a convertible as your only car in the depths of a British winter? Easy. For me. And I’d go as far as saying it would be easy for most childless readers who don’t regularly need to transport anything particularly large. </p>
<p>Bonus question: is this the spec to go for? At the office, we regularly talk specs. And, as you might imagine, we often disagree. A few of us think all <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-electric-cars">electric cars</a> should basically be the least powerful spec possible; others say we’re missing out on all the huge torque. Some of us insist there’s still room for diesel; others remind us that modern petrol hybrids can offer basically the same economy. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="600" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mazda-mx5-lt-murray-2024-me-3-1600x1067-589169dc-059d-4ee4-be56-f142d8d54bf6.jpg?itok=GOYnqO_W" width="900" /></p>
<p>But for the MX-5 top-rung Homura spec just makes sense. Recaro seats? Spot on. Even comfy on long journeys. Track mode? Simple, easy to use, flatters your driving and you can make use of it all the time. BBS wheels? Amazing – nothing else to note. </p>
<p>Yes, it’s £35k – which sounds a lot for an MX-5. But a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mini/cooper">Mini Cooper</a> convertible is £28,000, or £30k-plus if you actually want anything inside it. A <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/honda/civic-type-r">Honda Civic Type R</a> is £50k. At the beginning of this test, I posited that the latest ND was the culmination of 36 years of MX-5 expertise. And it is.</p>
<p>The next generation of Mazda sports car is promised to keep the atmospheric engine/rear-drive formula. But even so, I don’t envy the engineers tasked with besting this ND.</p>

<p>The Subaru Trailseeker has been revealed as an electric counterpart to the <a href="/car-review/subaru/outback">Outback estate</a> that prioritises off-road capabilities.</p>
<p>Subaru&#039;s first electric car to be developed in-house, it offers four-wheel drive and the same 8.3in (211mm) of ground clearance as the <a href="/car-news/new-cars/subaru-solterra-update-brings-radical-new-look-and-extra-power">Solterra electric SUV</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The machine will launch first in the USA in early 2026, but will be a key part of Subaru&#039;s plans to expand its EV line-up in Europe – although it has yet to be confirmed if the Trailseeker name will be used.</span></p>
<p>The Solterra is twinned with the Toyota bZ4X, and while the Trailseeker shares the same platform as those machines it has been conceived purely as a Subaru. Inoue Masahiko, Subaru&#039;s EV product manager, said it featured about 70% Subaru parts and would be built at one of the firm&#039;s factories, while the Solterra is manufactured by Toyota.</p>
<p>The Trailseeker packs a pair of 201bhp motors (one per axle) that offer a maximum system output of 375bhp, enabling a 0-60mph sprint time of 4.4sec. The Solterra features a smaller motor on the rear axle, and Inoue-san said the decision to offer two identical motors was made by Subaru to optimise its all-wheel-drive performance.</p>
<p>The machine&#039;s 74.kWh lithium lithium ion battery yields a range of 260 miles (on the US&#039;s EPA test cycle, rather than Europe&#039;s more lenient WLTP standard) and can be charged at rates of up to 150kW, so a 10-80% fill can take less than 35 minutes. </p>
<p>It can tow loads of up to 1588kg and offers several drive models for surfaces including snow and deep mud, as well as a hill descent control system.</p>
<p>Inside, it&#039;s said to offer slightly more cargo space than the Solterra, putting it on a par with the Outback.</p>
<p>There&#039;s a 14.0in infotainment touchscreen (the biggest fittest in a Subaru yet) and a high-set digital instrument panel too.</p>
<p>Subaru has yet to announce pricing, but the Trailseeker is likely to be positioned above the Solterra.</p>
<p>Deliveries will begin early next year in the US, with the UK and other European markets close behind. </p>
<p>As well as revealing the Trailseeker and a heavily revised <a href="/car-review/subaru/solterra">Solterra</a> at the New York motor show, Subaru has confirmed it will launch two more EVs this year – although only one of those will come to Europe.</p>
<p>While Subaru has yet to reveal details it&#039;s possible that - as the Solterra is twinned with the <a href="/car-review/toyota/bz4x">Toyota bZ4X</a> – this will be a restyled version of the new <a href="/car-news/new-cars/toyota-c-hr-revealed-338bhp-373-mile-ford-explorer-rival">Toyota C-HR+</a>. The two firms have an extended partnership to develop more joint EV models, although Subaru is working on its own purely developed in-house EVs for 2028 onwards.</p>

  Preview shows how new electric Juke will evolve from radical Hyper Punk concept</blockquote>
<figcaption>2026 Nissan Juke teaser image   front three quarters</figcaption></figure><div>
<p>The next-generation, electric <a href="/car-review/nissan/juke">Nissan Juke</a> has been previewed as the firm ramps up to beginning production at its Sunderland factory next year.</p>
<p>Partly shown behind the freshly unwrapped <a href="/car-news/new-cars/new-nissan-leaf-revealed-crossover-over-372-miles-range">Mk3 Leaf</a> and <a href="/car-news/new-cars/electric-nissan-micra-unwrapped-renault-5-twin-lands-2026">new electric Micra</a> (below), the new Juke will be closely linked to the current ICE Juke – alongside which it will be built – but take some influence from last year&#039;s radical Hyper Punk concept.</p>
<p>It will follow the Leaf down Nissan&#039;s UK production line from next year, and a next-generation, electric Qashqai is due to join them in the coming years - although the firm has delayed that car in light of uncertainties about global EV uptake.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="506" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/europe_nissan_range_teaser.jpg?itok=3BmiLUcW" width="900" /></p>
<p>Nissan has previously said it&#039;s aiming for the Juke EV to cost around the same as the current ICE Juke, which starts at around £21,000, although it has admitted that&#039;s a challenge.</p>
<p>The company has yet to give a precise launch timeline but has confirmed that the lifecycle of the current ICE Juke will be extended and it will be produced alongside the Juke EV. </p>
<p>Nissan has yet to reveal firm details about the Juke EV, although all three <a href="/car-news/new-cars/future-cars">future cars</a> for Sunderland are set to use the <a href="/car-review/renault">Renault</a>-Nissan-<a href="/car-review/mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a> Alliance&#039;s CMF-EV platform, which is designed for C- and D-segment EVs.</p>
<p>That suggests the Juke could potentially grow in size slightly: the current ICE Juke uses the CMF-B platform, which is designed for smaller, B-segment cars. </p>
<p>While no details of the Juke EV&#039;s performance have been given, t<span>he new Leaf, to which it&#039;s closely related, is set to offer a maximum range in excess of 372 miles.</span></p>
<p><img alt="Nissan Hyper Punk concept rear " class="image-body-image" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/nissan-juke-concept-rear.jpeg?itok=IbilbTzK" /></p>
<p>Despite the Juke, <a href="/car-review/nissan/qashqai">Qashqai</a> and Leaf all sharing a platform and being developed and built alongside each other, Nissan Europe&#039;s R&D chief, David Moss, previously said they would retain distinct characters, noting that they would feature different wheelbases. </p>
<p>He added: “As the size of the car grows, you change its ride and handling characteristics, or if it sits in a different segment, you might change the suspension.</p>
<p>“The beauty of developing three EVs [simultaneously] is the first thing you can look at is &#039;where do we want to commonise and where don’t we?&#039;. It’s all based around customer expectations and values.”</p>

<div>
<p>The facelifted Mk8.5 <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf">Volkswagen Golf</a> has already been the subject of a <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/new-vw-golf-takes-toyota-corolla-and-peugeot-308">group test</a> (1.5 eTSI 150) and a full road test (<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti">VW Golf GTI</a>) but, since the car’s chief mission was to correct the shortcomings of the flawed Mk8, you could say we’re still waiting to appreciate where its biggest gains have been made.</p>
<p>But there’s a good chance that we’re about to. Because no derivative of this car has been more widely overhauled than this new <strong>Volkswagen Golf eHybrid</strong>. Powered by a second-generation version of the Volkswagen Group’s four-cylinder plug-in hybrid powertrain, this Golf has taken significant technical and functional strides. With adoption of electric cars still not widespread, it sits in a unique position, being the first plug-in hybrid hatchback that we have tested in the 5% benefit-in-kind company car tax bracket.</p>
<p>That special status won’t endure, with the same powertrain heading to MQB Evo platform siblings from the Seat Leon to the Cupra Formentor. For now, though, it should be an effective fleet sales lever, as VW seeks to return the Golf to the top of Europe’s sales ranks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Design & styling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-golf-ehybrid-2024-review-badge-14.jpg" width="1598" height="1066" alt="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review badge 14" title="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review badge 14" /></p>
<div>
<p>This car’s hybrid system has already been rolled out on the likes of the Volkswagen Tiguan and Passat, but its potential is only now being fully realised on something as small and light as a regular hatchback.</p>
<p>The packaging challenges inherent to PHEVs in this class have meant only few have so far managed more than 40 miles of electric range, thereby avoiding BIK tax of 12%. But the Golf eHybrid’s official electric range of 88 miles allows it to be taxed at 5% (quite close, even, to the 2% levied on EVs).</p>
<p>That’s thanks to several technical advancements. The car’s nickel-manganese-cobalt drive battery now offers 19.7kWh of usable capacity (almost double that of the pre-facelifted car), and is more energy-dense than before, even accounting for the liquid cooling that VW has added to it (which helps facilitate better efficiency, as well as DC rapid charging at up to 50kW).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the old eHybrid’s 1.4-litre four-cylinder TSI engine has been replaced by a 148bhp, 184lb ft 1.5-litre ‘TSI Evo2’ unit that combines a variable-geometry turbocharger with a Miller-cycle combustion strategy. It drives the front wheels in parallel with a 107bhp, 258lb ft electric motor, and via a new six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox with ratios chosen for optimal petrol-electric efficiency. The combined output is 201bhp and 258lb ft, the same torque but 67bhp less than what the GTE’s closely related powertrain produces.</p>
<p>Unlike the GTE, the eHybrid is tuned for outright efficiency, comfort and electric range, says VW. But, being a higher-end Golf derivative, it still gets independent rear suspension. Our test car also had 18in alloy wheels (£585) and DCC adaptive dampers (£720) as optional extras.</p>

<h2>Interior</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-golf-ehybrid-2024-review-dash-27.jpg" width="1598" height="1066" alt="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review dash 27" title="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review dash 27" /></p>
<div>
<p>It’s a shame, with reference to the car’s comfort-first positioning, that VW didn’t think to make its excellent 14-way Ergoactive seats standard-fit. As it is, however, the Golf eHybrid offers a good, comfortable and fairly well-supported driving position; plenty of room for taller occupants up front; and just enough second-row space for average-height adults, without making the car itself feel overgrown for the compact class.</p>
<p>In the boot, any underfloor storage, or split-level boot configurability, is lost to the packaging of the power electronics and relocated fuel tank, but 273 litres is left. That would be more typical of a supermini than something from the class above, but it does at least offer a flat floor with the back seats folded down.</p>
<p>The car’s primary controls are intuitively positioned; the instrumentation is all-digital but clear and usefully configurable; and the new multimedia system (see our <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti">Golf GTI</a> road test for more details) is better laid out and easier to use than in the pre-facelifted car, albeit still missing some more simple, physical controls. As in other Golfs we have tested, material cabin quality is good rather than great.</p>
</div>
<h2>Engines & performance</h2><p><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-golf-ehybrid-2024-review-rear-corner-72.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review rear corner 72" title="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review rear corner 72" /></p></p>
<div>
<p>This Golf is a car of assured performance whose availability doesn’t seem to depend on a fully charged drive battery.</p>
<p>While the conditions may have been a factor in robbing the front axle of a little traction at nearly full charge (when it suffered flurries of momentary wheelspin), we actually recorded slightly faster standing-start acceleration when the battery was indicated as almost flat. This can be considered proof that the car suffers with little or no meaningful ‘charge drain’ performance deterioration.</p>
<p>With a GTE variant sold alongside it, of course, you might imagine eHybrid buyers to be less interested in outright performance than drivability, refinement, efficiency and EV range. In these respects, our test car hit fairly consistent high standards, its odd lapse here or there notable mostly in contrast with the prevailing maturity, smoothness and good manners that characterise the car more widely.</p>
<p>It almost always gets under way under hushed electric power. Selecting Sport driving mode doesn’t induce the combustion engine to run constantly, and so when you do use full power from rest, there is an instant when the car seems to have it all to do to get its pistons reciprocating, and then deliver combustion torque to the front axle. </p>
<p>And yet there’s no particular sense of it being flustered by the challenge. In electric-only running, meanwhile, there’s plenty of performance at speeds of up to 50mph. VW’s tachometer is useful in making it clear when a deeper dig of power will be likely to rouse the engine, which usually chimes in very quietly and smoothly, and only picks up any notable edge of coarseness at high revs and under load. Faster A-road and motorway running more often requires some combustive back-up – but even here extended zero-emissions cruising periods are easy to achieve.</p>
<p>The Golf eHybrid’s brake system showed no evidence of problems with fade on track. There was some strange pedal progression at low speed, but only on rare occasions and to a minor degree.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ride & handling</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-golf-ehybrid-2024-review-rear-corner-74.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review rear corner 74" title="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid 2024 review rear corner 74" /></p>
<div>
<p>There is an unmistakable sense of middle-of-the-market dynamic versatility to the very best examples of the VW Golf – and, despite its weight and the complexity of its powertrain, that’s the sort of car that the eHybrid feels like.</p>
<p>It’s not as light on its feet or as naturally nimble as some smaller hatchback rivals, but a comfort-focused rather than sporting dynamic brief does appear to make room for it to impress on the road in any case. The eHybrid combines a supple, fluent ride with decent outright grip and body control. It steers precisely, predictably and with tidy alacrity, without gesturing towards an incisive handling zeal that many owners would leave untapped anyway. This car has little greater ambition than simply to drive like a Golf – with maturity, measure and a little sophistication.</p>
<p>The optional DCC adaptive dampers afforded our car plenty of adjustability in its ride gait, allowing a supple, flowing B-road stride only occasionally troubled by poor wheel control over the sharpest of edges. When turned up to firm, those dampers also kept close tabs on body roll during limit handling testing, and helped to maintain good stability, steering authority and handling balance.</p>
<h2>Assisted Driving</h2>
<p>The Golf eHybrid’s upper-middle trim level affords it plenty of assisted driving technology as standard. There is the mandatory speed limit detection and reminder system, too, which defaults to ‘on’ at every ignition cycle (because that’s what the law dictates). Like the lane keeping system, however, this is made easy to deactivate via an ADAS shortcut icon permanently displayed on the upper margin of the infotainment screen.</p>
<p>The driver monitoring system isn’t bothersome, and the automatic emergency braking isn’t prone to intrusive false activation.</p>
<p>Using the Travel Assist mode of the cruise control activates VW’s various semi-autonomous cruise functions. They work better here than on other VW models we have tested recently because the system isn’t so prescriptive about how and where you hold the steering wheel in order to keep it engaged, and so doesn’t threaten to drop out with unnecessary beeps and stabs of the brakes.<img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="469" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vw_golf_ehybrid_2024_noise.jpg?itok=F_ca-EMv" width="900" /></p>
</div>

<h2>MPG & running costs</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/vw_golf_ehybrid_front_cornering.jpg" width="1600" height="1060" alt="VW Golf eHybrid front cornering" title="VW Golf eHybrid front cornering" /></p>
<div>
<p>A starting price just above £37,000 makes this a moderately expensive Golf – some 20% pricier than a less-powerful mild-hybrid petrol or TDI diesel – but it doesn’t appear to exist to exploit its fleet-friendly tax status for profit, or to have been made prohibitively expensive for retail buyers.</p>
<p>That’s about what you would expect to pay for a European electric hatchback, of course; but since the eHybrid offers much of the running appeal and cost advantages of an EV anyway, as well as combustion-engined back-up, the car justifies its price tag easily enough – not least given that 88-mile electric range.</p>
<p>We averaged 66 miles in mixed use during the course of our test, which is probably about double the real-world PHEV hatchback class average. It’s enough to meaningfully change how you choose to fuel the car in day-to-day use, and how often you need to buy petrol.</p>
<p>Over a week’s testing of a little over 500 miles, including plenty of residential charging and short-range trips but also several hours of intensive track testing, we only managed to half-empty the car’s petrol tank. The 108mpg test average looks phenomenally efficient, though it’s more reflective of how we chose to fuel it than how efficient it may be in ‘range-extended’ running (see our touring and everyday economy test results, left, for that). In electric-only running, the 3.4mpkWh average in mixed-road testing is in itself competitive with actual EVs of similar size.<img alt="" class="image-body-image" height="386" src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vw_golf_ehybrid_2024_running_efficiency.jpg?itok=ZLALwgqH" width="900" /></p>
</div>

<h2>Verdict</h2><p><img src="https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/volkswagen-golf-ehybrid-front-static-2.jpg" width="1599" height="1066" alt="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid front static 2" title="Volkswagen Golf eHybrid front static 2" /></p>
<div>
<p>Volkswagen has put a new complexion on the case for the plug-in hybrid hatchback as a smart alternative to both traditional ICE and EV rivals.</p>
<p>With nearly 70 miles of dependable real-world EV range, DC rapid charging included, and assertive, efficient and pleasant ‘range-extended’ running thereafter, the Golf eHybrid really does represent a new and appealing ownership proposition.</p>
<p>This car enters a part of the market where PHEV options have struggled to produce really transformative electric range for an affordable price thus far. But this is a plug-in hybrid that genuinely is like an EV to drive a great deal of the time, and that isn&#039;t priced to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>The Volkswagen Golf eHybrid could genuinely deliver lasting change to your motoring habits – and all from a position of calm reassurance.</p>
