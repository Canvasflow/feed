<p>Less than two hours before she was set to hit the stage on July 4, <strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong> canceled the opening night of her highly anticipated Studio Sessions residency at Caesars Palace to avoid potential injury to her voice.</p>
<p>â€œShe belts out every single note,â€ a Las Vegas insider spilled to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/07/08/celebrity-news/kelly-clarksons-hidden-battles-contributed-to-show-cancellations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Page Six</em></a> on the reasons behind the sudden change of plans. â€œSheâ€™s an incredibly powerful singer, but it takes its toll on her vocal cords and sheâ€™s come incredibly close to needing surgery before.â€</p>
<p>â€œShe cannot risk damaging her cords further,â€ explained the insider. â€œSheâ€™s on thin ice.â€</p>
<p>A second source revealed that Clarkson, 43, is struggling with â€œ<a href="https://starmagazine.com/kelly-clarkson-weighs-future-on-daytime-tv-while-managing-health-and-divorce-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious hidden battles</a>â€ that â€œvery few people are privy to.â€</p>
<p>â€œKellyâ€™s personal life is so insanely complicated,â€ the source shares. â€œItâ€™s a source of emotional, and therefore, physical distress for her.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10831" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2570px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10831" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-300x169.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-768x432.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306262_007-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The &#8220;Because of You&#8221; singer&#8217;s 18-show residency at the Colosseum was announced in February, causing many fans to rush to buy tickets. However, they were left disappointed when Clarkson was forced to cancel her first and second shows on such short notice â€“ especially seeing as some fans from out of state had booked pricey travel and hotels so that they could attend.</p>
<p>Shortly after her decision to postpone the concert, a â€œdevastatedâ€ Clarkson took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLtSYHSptF4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=30da1b9e-1705-452f-8e99-a0b2e8f5f3b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> on July 4, to explain the upsetting situation to her followers.</p>
<p>â€œWe have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fansâ€™â€ she said at the time. â€œThe prep and rehearsals have taken a toll on my voice.â€</p>
<p>â€œI want the shows to be perfect for yâ€™all and I need to protect myself from doing serious damage so I am taking this weekend and next week to rest up so that we can deliver what you all deserve,â€ she continued. â€œThe show is truly incredible. The musicians and singers are outstanding, and I want us all to start out strong. I canâ€™t wait to be back next weekend and show yâ€™all what weâ€™ve been working on.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10830" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2570px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10830" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1793" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-300x210.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-768x538.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-1536x1076.jpg 1536w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/upiphotosthree042301-2048x1435.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">JOHN ANGELILLO/UPI/Newscom/The Mega Agency</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While some fans in the comments section offered her words of love and support, others were left frustrated and suggested her decision was â€œdisrespectfulâ€ to attendees.</p>
<p>One person wrote, â€œIâ€™m literally here in a homemade Kelly Clarkson T-shirt. I spent $700 on flights and $1000 on [the] hotel. Canceling one hour before the show is INSANE.â€</p>
<p>A second person pointed out, â€œThe crazy part is there isnâ€™t even an apology in this post.â€</p>
<p>â€œI wish you wouldâ€™ve done this sooner than 15 mins before doors opening,â€ a third fan chimed in, before adding, â€œI hope you feel better.â€</p>

<p><strong>Rihanna</strong> and <strong>ASAP Rocky</strong> love a theme â€“ especially when it comes to baby names!</p>
<p>The â€œUmbrellaâ€ singer, 37, dropped a <a href="https://starmagazine.com/aap-rocky-drops-clue-about-name-of-baby-no-3-with-rihanna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playful hint</a> at what they plan to call their third child at the premiere of her new animated flick <em>Smurfs</em>, in which she voices Smurfette.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s always going to be an R name,â€ she teased to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLgJraLOfMU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=61703d03-61b9-45f1-95f7-38c10168c24c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a>. She and ASAP already share sons <strong>RZA</strong>, 3, and <strong>Riot</strong>, 23 months. â€œThatâ€™s the one thing me and Rocky donâ€™t fight over.â€</p>
<p>But RiRi isnâ€™t the only one giving out clues! As <em>Star</em> previously reported, ASAP, 36, appeared to hint that they may be <a href="https://starmagazine.com/rihanna-shares-rare-photos-of-sons-after-asap-rocky-hints-theyre-having-a-baby-girl-road-trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having a baby girl</a> while speaking with <em>ET</em>â€™s <strong>Kevin Frazier</strong>. As they discussed the â€œPon de Replayâ€ singerâ€™s pregnancy, Frazier playfully asked, â€œIs that the girl youâ€™ve been waiting for?â€</p>
<p>â€œIt is, man, it is,â€ ASAP said, then he held up a Smurfette toy. â€œRight here, right here.â€</p>
<p>â€œYou know what Iâ€™m asking!â€ Frazier replied, causing ASAP to laugh.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the conversation, when he was asked if they planned on having any more children in the future, the â€œF**kinâ€™ Problemsâ€ rapper joked, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be like the Wayans family, you know? I mean, love is beautiful, and it&#8217;s just spreading it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rihanna also quipped that they could be expecting a â€œSmurfette,â€ while talking with <em>ET</em>, but she played coy as she quickly added, â€œCould be a Papa Smurf, who knows?â€</p>
<p>Earlier this month, an insider claimed the soon-to-be parents of three â€œcouldnâ€™t be more thrilled to be growing their family againâ€ as they await their newest bundle of joy.</p>
<p>â€œTheyâ€™ve really embraced this chapter,â€ the insider told <a href="https://people.com/asap-rocky-rihanna-biggest-cheerleader-prepare-baby-number-three-exclusive-11766492" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>People</em> </a>on July 6, â€œand their bond has only deepened since becoming parents.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10800" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1408px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10800" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rihann-asap-rocky-MEGA1271825_020.jpg" alt="" width="1398" height="1080" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rihann-asap-rocky-MEGA1271825_020.jpg 1398w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rihann-asap-rocky-MEGA1271825_020-300x232.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rihann-asap-rocky-MEGA1271825_020-1024x791.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rihann-asap-rocky-MEGA1271825_020-768x593.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1398px) 100vw, 1398px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">Snorlax / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASAP has also been an â€œincredibly attentiveâ€ partner and â€œso hands-onâ€ with the boys <a href="https://starmagazine.com/rihanna-reveals-major-family-update-at-met-gala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throughout this pregnancy</a>, according to the insider.</p>
<p>â€œHeâ€™s always thinking of ways to show up for Rihanna, whether itâ€™s bringing her late night cravings when sheâ€™s in the mood or creating little ways for her to unwind,â€ the insider continued. &#8220;Heâ€™ll run her baths, massage her feet and take care of things around the house so she doesnâ€™t have to lift a finger.â€</p>
<p>â€œRocky is Rihannaâ€™s biggest cheerleader,â€ the insider noted. â€œHe always makes her laugh, he keeps things light and full of love. They both prioritize their family time above everything and itâ€™s clear this is what matters most to them.â€</p>

<p>Johnny Depp is reflecting on his turbulent childhood, which included heavy drug use and physical abuse.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/07/05/johnny-depp-i-dont-care-what-people-say-about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Telegraph</a></em> published Saturday, July 5, the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> star, 62, recalled how, in the early 1990s, an interviewer asked him why kids would be interested in watching him play an undercover police officer going on drug busts in the TV series <em>21 Jump Street</em>. He gave a candid response, saying that he had extensive experience with drugs.</p>
<p>â€œAnd I said, â€™Well, thatâ€™s easy. â€˜Cause I started taking drugs when I was about 11.â€™ And then I went through the whole thing. And she asked me, have you tried marijuana? I went &#8216;uh-huh.&#8217; Cocaine? &#8216;Uh-huh.&#8217; Heroin? &#8216;Uh-huh.&#8217; I mean you name it because thatâ€™s how I grew up,&#8221; Depp admitted. &#8220;By the time I was 15, 16, I had a pretty decent chance at a doctorate in pharmacology and alcohol mixing and drinking.â€</p>

<p>Depp played Officer Thomas &#8220;Tom&#8221; Hanson, Jr. for four seasons of the procedural drama series, which aired on Fox from 1987 to 1990. However, he told <em>The Telegraph</em> that &#8220;the last thing&#8221; he wanted was to be known only as a &#8220;TV actor.&#8221;</p>
<p>â€œI didnâ€™t like the labels,&#8221; the <em>Edward Scissorhands</em> actor admitted. &#8220;What they were desperate to do was just make me a poster boy: â€˜Heâ€™s the new James Dean.â€™ No, Iâ€™m not.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Depp also opened up about the abuse he endured as an adolescent at the hands of his mother, <strong>Betty Sue</strong>, who passed away in 2016 at age 81.</p>
<p>â€œShe beat me with a f**king stick, a f**king shoe, an ashtray, a phone, it didnâ€™t matter, man,&#8221; he told the outlet. &#8220;But I thank her for that. She taught me how not to raise kids. Just do the exact opposite of what she did.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10772" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2058px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10772" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="2560" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-240x300.jpg 240w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-768x960.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/khphotos069489-1638x2048.jpg 1638w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">2007 Kathy Hutchins / Hutchins/Newscom/The Mega Agency</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Depp shares two children with ex-girlfriend <strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong>: daughter <strong>Lily-Rose</strong>, 26, and son <strong>Jack</strong>, 23.</p>
<p>In 2022, Depp discussed his substance use during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QCf2GWUE4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defamation trial</a> â€” which he won â€” against ex-wife <strong>Amber Heard</strong>, whom he was married to from 2015 to 2017. Depp explained he used drugs to &#8220;numb&#8221; himself, and it started when he would give his mom her &#8220;nerve pills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was 11 years old, I wanted to calm down, and I didn&#8217;t know how to, so I would bring my mom her nerve pill,&#8221; he recounted. &#8220;I would walk away, and I would take one myself to escape. Caring so much, feeling so much, to escape the chaotic nature of what we were living through.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>TimothÃ©e Chalamet </strong>and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> both lead extravagant lifestyles â€” but according to a source, the actor, 29, is feeling some financial pressure in the relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Timmy has made millions of dollars over the last three years with this run of hits he&#8217;s been on, but even after all that, his wealth pales in comparison to Kylie&#8217;s,&#8221; the source tells <em>Star</em>. &#8220;He&#8217;s doing his best to keep up, and he and Kylie have bonded on these expensive trips and vacations they&#8217;ve taken over the last several months, but Timmy does feel the pinch when he&#8217;s splurging on Kylie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chalamet and Jenner, 27 â€” who began dating in 2023 and have been going strong ever since â€” have taken numerous getaways together. They were most recently <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/kylie-jenner-and-timothee-chalamet-seen-holding-hands-in-saint-tropez-ahead-of-dune-part-3-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted vacationing in the South of France</a> this month.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10541" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1470px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10541" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340.jpg" alt="" width="1460" height="2480" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340.jpg 1460w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340-177x300.jpg 177w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340-603x1024.jpg 603w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340-768x1305.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340-904x1536.jpg 904w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1306768_001-scaled-e1751907899340-1206x2048.jpg 1206w" sizes="(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;They both love high-end experiences and luxury accommodations, and Timmy&#8217;s fame can open doors to the finer things in life,&#8221; the source explained. â€œHe&#8217;s just too proud of his own success to ever want to ride Kylie&#8217;s coat tails financially, and that&#8217;s been the dynamic between them from the beginning.â€</p>
<p>While the <em>Call Me by Your Name</em> star has had a financially rewarding career on the big screen thus far, the source noted that the Kylie Cosmetics founder&#8217;s wealth is &#8220;just on a different level.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Timmy&#8217;s credit, he is more than capable of buckling down and getting serious when he&#8217;s making a movie, and he tries to keep the downtime with Kylie as stress free as possible,&#8221; the source continued. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that he could have 10 more years of massive Hollywood success and still not come close to matching the wealth she has amassed during her 20s.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_10740" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2570px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10740" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1783" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-300x209.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-768x535.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-1536x1070.jpg 1536w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1303569_006-2048x1427.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/kylie-jenner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a></em>, Jenner&#8217;s net worth in 2025 is estimated around $670 million. As for Chalamet, most of his film salaries are unknown, but <em><a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/features/movie-star-salaries-joaquin-phoenix-joker-2-tom-cruise-1235320046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a></em> reported that he earned $9 million from the 2023 musical movie <em>Wonka</em>.</p>
<p>Chalamet will be back on set soon, as filming for<em> Dune: Part Three</em> is expected to commence sometime this summer, according to <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/dune-3-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-begin-filming-summer-2025-1236293617/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a></em>.</p>
<p>A separate source told <em><a href="https://starmagazine.com/why-timothee-chalamets-filming-schedule-for-dune-part-three-will-be-a-test-for-kylie-jenner-exclusive/?format=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star</a></em> last month that Jenner â€” who shares daughter <strong>Stormi</strong>, 7, and son <strong>Aire</strong>, 3, with ex <strong>Travis Scott</strong> â€” â€œcanâ€™t uproot for six months to follow Timmy to any set.â€ As a result, the source said the couple has promised each other to take â€œlavish vacationsâ€ during their â€œrare mutual downtime.â€</p>

<p><strong>Frankie Muniz</strong> is getting candid about feeling taken advantage of by the people in his life.</p>
<p>On Monday, July 7, the <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> star, 39, took to <a href="https://x.com/frankiemuniz/status/1942319709078327426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> to share a heartfelt message about always being the person others rely on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels like my wife and I are always there when friends or family need a favor or helping out, lending stuff, you name it. Basically my whole life I&#8217;ve been asked for things. It&#8217;s really the only reason anyone calls me,&#8221; Muniz wrote. &#8221; But when we need a hand with something, whereâ€™s everyone at? Anyone else feel like theyâ€™re giving more than they get back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fans took to the comment section to empathize with the two-time Golden Globe-nominated actor and share their take on the situation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10729" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1691px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10729" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1681" height="2560" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-scaled.jpg 1681w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-197x300.jpg 197w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-672x1024.jpg 672w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-768x1170.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-1009x1536.jpg 1009w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/starmax008605-1345x2048.jpg 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1681px) 100vw, 1681px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">Russ Einhorn/STAR MAX, Inc./Newscom/The Mega Agency</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;I super get it buddy. But I always try to remind myself that I cannot expect me from other people,&#8221; one fan wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spot on take,&#8221; a second fan commented. &#8220;I followed you based on that alone. I&#8217;m sorry this is the case for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesnâ€™t sound like the people in your circle are your friends. It should be mutual,&#8221; a third fan chimed in.</p>
<p>Muniz famously starred in the hit sitcom <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, which aired on Fox for seven seasons from 2000 to 2006. After wrapping up the series, Muniz shifted his focus to racing, becoming a professional raceâ€‘car driver. He is currently a driver in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.</p>
<p>In March, the <em>Big Fat Liar</em> actor appeared on the <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTtGhHQQeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobby Bones Show</a></em> and discussed how he balances racing, his family life and acting â€” he is returning to TV in an upcoming reboot of<em> Malcolm in the Middle</em> on Disney+.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10731" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2570px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10731" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2048" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-300x240.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-768x614.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1297857_005-2048x1639.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;I can honestly say racing right now is 100 percent my focus. I&#8217;m doing everything I can every day to be as prepared as possible. That said, we are about to start filming the Malcolm reboot during the season. I have a 3-year-old, I have a wife, I&#8217;m building a house, and I&#8217;m trying to figure out that balance,&#8221; Muniz, who tied the knot with <strong>Paige Price</strong> in 2019, explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out, you know, that maybe sometimes it is okay to say no to certain things. I&#8217;ve never been that person. I&#8217;ve always been like, &#8216;Yeah yeah yeah, I&#8217;ll do it, I could do that, I could do it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Muniz added that he doesn&#8217;t want to have regrets in his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;[I&#8217;m] just trying to make sure that I&#8217;m giving 100 percent to everything I&#8217;m doing because I don&#8217;t want to look back at the end of the year and go, &#8216;Darn, I could have tried harder,&#8217; or &#8216;I wish I didn&#8217;t phone that in,&#8217; and also still be a good husband and a good father,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely tough. I feel like life is flying by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Does <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> have a new man?</p>
<p>The <em>Morning Show</em> star, 56, sent the rumor mills into overdrive after she was spotted vacationing with life coach and <a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-aniston-says-hypnosis-is-helping-her-overcome-extreme-fear-of-flying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hypnotist <strong>Jim Curtis</strong></a> in Mallorca, Spain, during 4th of July weekend.</p>
<p>Aniston looked comfortable and carefree in a black tank top and light-wash blue jeans. She accessorized the casual â€˜fit with a wide-brimmed hat, a pair of sunglasses, and a cream-colored crossbody bag in photos obtained by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14883421/jennifer-aniston-romance-rumors-jim-curtis-vacation-mallorca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. Meanwhile, Curtis sported a similar relaxed look in a long-sleeved green shirt and black shorts.</p>
<p>They appeared to be spending time with friends on the outing, as they were also seen with Anistonâ€™s longtime pals <strong>Jason Bateman</strong> and his wife, <strong>Amanda Anka</strong>. Later, the group reportedly attended a yacht party together at the popular travel destination.</p>
<p>While the former <em>Friends</em> actress has not spoken out on whether her connection with Curtis is friendship, romance or simply business<em>, Star</em> confirmed she is following his Instagram account and has also â€œlikedâ€ several of his posts. One of his recent videos even hinted at how to move on from past relationships and improve oneâ€™s love life.</p>
<p>â€œRepeat these affirmation[s] to heal and recover from a divorce, breakup or difficult romance and begin to call in the new empowered, <a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-aniston-pedro-pascal-are-they-really-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy and divine love</a>,â€ he captioned a July 2 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLm7BaoR8-S/?hl=en">video</a>. â€œ3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, 9 times at night before bed.â€</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that love can be consistent, kind and true,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s safe for me to be seen, loved and chosen. I release the pain of the past.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_10721" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1717px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10721" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1707" height="2560" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-200x300.jpg 200w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-aniston-MEGA1104197_018-1365x2048.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">C Flanigan/imageSPACE / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This also isnâ€™t the first time theyâ€™ve been photographed out and about together. As<em> Star</em> previously reported, Aniston â€“ who has been married twice, first to<strong> Brad Pitt</strong>, 61, and then to <strong>Justin Theroux</strong>, 53 â€“ was also <a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-aniston-has-never-been-stronger-in-both-body-and-mind-than-at-the-age-of-56-says-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted at a restaurant</a> with the hypnotist in the Big Sur area in Northern California in June.</p>
<p>Over the years, the <em>Just Go With It</em> actress has been open about expressing her desire to have a serious relationship again some day.</p>
<p>â€œThere are moments I want to just crawl up in a ball and say, â€˜I need support.â€™ It would be wonderful to come home and fall into somebodyâ€™s arms and say, â€˜That was a tough day,â€™â€ she told <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/jennifer-aniston-december-2022-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Allure</em></a> in 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a source told <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-is-dating-again-nearly-7-years-after-divorce-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Life &amp; Style</em></a> that she is dating again â€“ but she&#8217;s also &#8220;very good&#8221; at keeping her romantic life private.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s all happening behind closed doors,â€ the source revealed in February. â€œShe meets them at the houses of their mutual friends, or they come to her house. She much prefers to control the situation and guard her privacy.â€</p>

<p><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> is turning 56 on July 24, and according to a source, sheâ€™s planning to spoil herself for her first birthday since her divorce from <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> was finalized â€“ celebrations could even last well into the summer!</p>
<p>â€œSheâ€™ll be in Europe on her tour but has arranged to have a few days off for her birthday so she can properly celebrate,â€ a source exclusively tells <em>Star</em>, referring to her current Up All Night: Live Tour. â€œSheâ€™s going to fly out some of her close friends so that sheâ€™s not alone and theyâ€™ll all get the A-list treatment right alongside her.â€</p>
<p>â€œRight now, itâ€™s a toss up between renting out a huge yacht and cruising the Med for a couple of days,â€ continues the source, â€œor just renting out a five-star villa where they can lounge and get spa treatments and have a big party and totally let loose.â€</p>
<p>Last year, J.Lo, 55, went all out and â€œthrew a huge partyâ€ for her big day, but the source says it was â€œ<a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-lopez-explains-how-she-got-injured-rehearsing-for-her-amas-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very painful</a>â€ for her due to her then-recent separation from Affleck, 52.</p>
<p>After rekindling their early 2000â€™s romance, Bennifer 2.0 tied the knot in a private Las Vegas ceremony in July 2022, followed by a second wedding in Georgia surrounded by family and friends that August. However, by April 2024, the pair had called it quits and their divorce was finalized in January 2025.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10622" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1944px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10622" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1934" height="2560" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-scaled.jpg 1934w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-227x300.jpg 227w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-774x1024.jpg 774w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-768x1017.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-1160x1536.jpg 1160w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-birthday-plans2-1547x2048.jpg 1547w" sizes="(max-width: 1934px) 100vw, 1934px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">Lisa OConnor/AFF-USA.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Their separation left her going â€œthrough the motionsâ€ and â€œcrying for a lotâ€ of her 55th birthday celebration, according to the source.</p>
<p>â€œThis year, sheâ€™s in a way better place and is actually in the mood to party,â€ the source adds. â€œSheâ€™s finally ready to put herself first again and she plans to go big, blow off steam and celebrate like the true superstar she is.â€</p>
<p>This comes one month after an insider spilled to<em> Star</em> that Lopez has been eager to â€œhave funâ€ on the European leg of her tour.</p>
<p>â€œSheâ€™s looking into chartering a fully crewed yacht and being <a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-lopez-and-brett-goldstein-cozy-up-after-office-romance-wrap-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surrounded by hot guys</a> and her trusted entourage,â€Â  the insider dished in June. â€œShe always thought <strong>Leo DiCaprio</strong> had it made, and she plans on being the female equivalent.â€</p>
<p>But just because sheâ€™s single and may be mingling with attractive bachelors doesnâ€™t mean sheâ€™s ready to move on with a new relationship just yet. Following the 2025 American Music Awards, the <em>Hustlers</em> star joked that actress <strong>Tiffany Haddish</strong> wanted to <a href="https://starmagazine.com/jennifer-lopez-plans-luxe-summer-escape-with-her-inner-circle-and-european-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go â€œmanhunting</a>â€ with her.</p>
<p>â€œShe said that to me!â€ Lopez told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3BdFUnmDE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Access Hollywood</em></a> at the time. â€œI said, &#8216;Girl, I&#8217;m not looking for no man. I&#8217;m happy right now. I&#8217;m not trying to ruin it, okay?â€™â€</p>

<p><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> and <strong>TimothÃ©e Chalamet</strong> soaked up the sun in Saint-Tropez, France, ahead of the actorâ€™s rigorous filming schedule for <em>Dune: Part 3</em>.</p>
<p>The Kylie Cosmetics founder, 27, and the <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> star, 29 â€” who have been dating for more than two years â€” were seen holding hands in Shellona Beach earlier this month. Kylieâ€™s sister, <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, also appeared to be in the neighborhood during their Southern France getaway, though she was pictured separately from the lovebirds as she explored the luxurious coastal town.</p>
<p>The mother of two â€” who shares daughter <strong>Stormi</strong>, 7, and son <strong>Aire</strong>, 3, with ex <strong>Travis Scott</strong> â€” looked gorgeous in a black and white striped dress and a pair of stylish sunglasses as her dark hair blew in the breeze. In the photos obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/06/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-hold-hands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TMZ</em></a>, TimothÃ©e could be seen beside her sporting a green and white Nigeria jersey with a matching green head scarf tied over a blue cap.</p>
<p>As <em>Star</em> previously reported, Kylie and TimothÃ©e&#8217;s romantic vacation comes as the 29-year-old gets ready to shoot the next installment of the <em>Dune</em> franchise, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/dune-3-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-begin-filming-summer-2025-1236293617/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported is said to begin this summer.</p>
<p>According to a source, the intense filming schedule could end up being a <a href="https://starmagazine.com/why-timothee-chalamets-filming-schedule-for-dune-part-three-will-be-a-test-for-kylie-jenner-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardship for their relationship</a> as â€œthose movies take forever to film,â€ and they will be jetting around â€œthe Middle East and Eastern Europeâ€ to do it.</p>
<p>While <strong>Tom Holland</strong> reportedly traveled with fiancÃ©e <strong>Zendaya</strong> during the production of <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, the source said Kylie has her own obligations in Los Angeles at the moment and â€œcanâ€™t uproot for six months to follow Timmy to any set.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10515" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 2570px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10515" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1696" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-300x199.jpg 300w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-768x509.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1335565_005-2048x1357.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">Fred Duval/MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for TimothÃ©e, he â€œwouldnâ€™t have said yes to more <em>Dune</em> if he didnâ€™t get something out of the extended time away from Kylie and her family situation,â€ added the source. â€œItâ€™s something he couldnâ€™t say no to, but this will be a huge test of their romance for sure.â€</p>
<p>Despite the demands of their bustling careers, a separate insider told <em>Star</em> that the pairâ€™s relationship â€œhas really deepened over the past few months or soâ€ and that the<em> Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em> alum even hopes to build a family with him one day.</p>
<p>â€œSheâ€™s all in on a long-term future and believes Timmy will <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/kylie-jenner-dreams-of-baby-number-three-as-her-romance-with-timothee-chalamet-reaches-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a wonderful dad</a>,â€ the insider revealed in May, noting that TimothÃ©e â€œwants kidsâ€ but isnâ€™t ready to jump into parenthood just yet. â€œKylie knows better than to push too hard, but she hopes Timmy will change his stance now that sheâ€™s planted the seed.â€</p>

<p><strong>Justin Bieber</strong> is seemingly shutting down rumors that his marriage to wife <strong>Haliley Bieber</strong> is in trouble.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 6, the pop star, 31, shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLyDkYWImO_/?igsh=bnk3N2FlZ3FqbmJr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram carousel</a> filled with romantic photos featuring the Rhode founder, 28. In the sweet snaps, the couple sit on a bench and hold each other closely in front of a sunset as he smiles.</p>

<p>The post came on the heels of a previous carousel shared by Justin that same day, in which he shared sweaty selfies that he captioned â€œDetoxxxxxxxxxxx.&#8221; The two-time Grammy Award winner did not specify what he was detoxing from.</p>

<p>Justin and Hailey â€” who share 10-month-old son <strong>Jack Blues</strong> â€” have been dealing with rumors about the state of their marriage for months, with many fans expressing concern about Justinâ€™s well-being.</p>
<p>On June 12, Justin made headlines after he confronted paparazzi outside Soho House in Malibu. Heâ€™s also been on a major <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/what-fans-really-think-about-justin-biebers-new-instagram-handle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting spree</a> on social media recently â€” and in a June 16 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DK9m8DrR604/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=invalid&amp;ig_rid=617164c4-e895-49ac-baae-d0e8ffb0d790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, he called himself &#8220;broken&#8221; and admitted to having &#8220;anger issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>A source told<em> <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/hailey-bieber-is-emotionally-exhausted-with-justins-behavior-as-fears-for-his-well-being-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star</a></em> last month that Hailey was â€œemotionally exhaustedâ€ by her hubby&#8217;s â€œongoing stretch of erratic behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source claimed that Hailey â€œhas begged Justin to take some space,&#8221; adding, â€œSheâ€™s clear that itâ€™s not a step toward divorce, but just time to regroup somewhere private. If not rehab, somewhere he can go to focus on wellness and self-care.â€</p>
<p>â€œHaileyâ€™s made it clear that without some kind of break, she doesnâ€™t know how much longer she and Justin can keep going,â€ the source added.</p>

<p>In her May <em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-summer-cover-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vogue</a></em> cover, Hailey addressed the <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/hailey-bieber-steps-out-without-her-wedding-ring-as-justin-shares-video-about-the-silent-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public&#8217;s obsession</a> with her marriage to Justin, who she wed in 2018.</p>
<p>â€œWell, I thought seven years in it wouldâ€™ve already [died down], and it hasnâ€™t,&#8221; she told the outlet at the time. &#8220;You would think after having a child, people would maybe move on, chill out a little bit, but no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a real life,â€ she continued. â€œMy real life is that I get to wake up to my beautiful family and my son and my friends and I have people that know me and love me and I love them.â€</p>
<p>However, after the <em>Vogue</em> cover was published, Justin shared a photo of it on his Instagram and detailed a â€œhuge fightâ€ between him and Hailey in which he told her â€œshe would never be on the cover of Vogueâ€ in his caption.</p>
<p>He later changed the caption to read â€œðŸ¤·ðŸ«µðŸ»ðŸ«¶ðŸ¼ðŸ¥¹â€ â€” leading fans to believe there may have been tension between the two following his initial post.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Irwin</strong> confessed to accidentally dining and dashing while stopping for lunch during a road trip in a hilarious Instagram update.</p>
<p>The trouble began when he stopped for a â€œbit of dinnerâ€ at a restaurant called the Jetty Pavilion in Coffs Harbour, which he called â€œa beautiful, coastal town in northern New South Wales.â€</p>
<p>â€œLittle did I know, this place is the place to be in Coffs Harbour,â€ he gushed of the establishment in the Saturday, July 5, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLvztD7Bmrd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>. â€œIt was packed.â€</p>
<p>Things quickly got hectic when the other customers <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/prince-william-gives-radio-show-playful-warning-about-robert-irwin-watch-your-back-at-all-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognized him</a> and wanted to chat with him and pose for photos.</p>
<p>â€œIt turned into a bit of a frenzy. It was a bit of a flurry there for a minute,&#8221; Irwin, 21, continued as he praised the local dining spot. â€œThey were so nice. They got the salad super fast. I made sure I said hi to absolutely everyone.â€</p>
<p>However, the next morning, the conservationist had the shocking epiphany that heâ€™d completely forgotten to pay for his salad in all the excitement.</p>
<p>â€œI just did the old dine and dash, and I didn&#8217;t even realize I&#8217;d done it,â€ he explained. â€œI felt terrible.â€</p>
<figure id="attachment_10465" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1771px;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10465" src="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1761" height="2560" srcset="https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-scaled.jpg 1761w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-206x300.jpg 206w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-705x1024.jpg 705w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-768x1116.jpg 768w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-1057x1536.jpg 1057w, https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MEGA1133402_067-1409x2048.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 1761px) 100vw, 1761px" /><figcaption class="mtSubImg"><span class="wp-desc-text"></span> <span class="wp-caption-text">Steven Bergman/AFF-USA.com / MEGA</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Irwin said that he contacted the restaurant as soon as he realized his mistake and that he offered to pay them through Venmo, but they told him not to worry about it and to just leave them a good review. Instead, he decided to share the glowing account of the mix-up to his nearly 8 million followers on Instagram as he encouraged them to go and â€œsupportâ€ the eatery.</p>
<p>He also promised to come back through and give them the money for the salad in person because â€œtoday is not the day I start my life of crime.â€</p>
<p>In response, Jetty Pavillion took to the comments section to thank him and said they were â€œblown awayâ€ by his visit â€“ they even hinted that an <a href="https://www.starmagazine.com/robert-irwin-gets-teary-eyed-hearing-late-dad-steve-irwin-talk-about-his-legacy-its-an-honor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irwin-inspired item</a> could be on the menu in the future.</p>
<p>â€œBeing from a humble little coastal town, it means the world to us to have you stop by.Â  Weâ€™re all huge fans, and truly appreciate the shoutout,â€ they wrote. â€œWe can only imagine how hard it must be to enjoy a quiet meal without being bombarded so thank you again for choosing us, and no stress about missing the payment! Weâ€™d absolutely love to have you back anytimeâ€¦ we might even have to name a salad after you.â€</p>
<p>â€œSeriously canâ€™t get over this we LOVE the Irwins!â€ they added in a follow-up comment. â€œWho else grew up watching these guys?â€</p>
