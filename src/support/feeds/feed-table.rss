<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>

<p>Apple is not generally known for self-effacement. After all, the Cupertino giant typically makes sure that its users notice and appreciate every single iterative improvement in its iPhones, no matter how granular.</p>



<p>So, it was only a matter of time when Apple turned its attention to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-17-pro-max-aluminum-a19-camera-upgrades/">iPhone 17 Pro's vapor chamber</a>, which constitutes one of the biggest under-the-hood changes for the new model.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-releases-a-new-video-to-highlight-the-capabilities-of-the-iphone-17-pro-s-new-vapor-chamber">Apple releases a new video to highlight the capabilities of the iPhone 17 Pro's new vapor chamber </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="iPhone 17 Pro | A19 Pro Chip | Peak Performance | Apple" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJObc0V6hJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Apple has just released a new video on its YouTube channel, representing its A19 Pro chip as an athlete in an arid environment, who is shown contending with "35 trillion complex tasks a second," with evaporative cooling - the critical element in a vapor chamber - playing an outsized role in ensuring the optimal performance of the chip. According to Apple, "when you run cool, you can push your limits."</p>



<p>For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the iPhone 17 Pro features a laser-welded aluminum chamber that contains deionized water, which absorbs heat from the components and turns into vapor, effectively cooling down the critical components in close proximity. The vapor then moves away from the heat source, cools by transferring heat to the outer frame, and turns back into liquid water. The cycle continues to repeat. </p>



<p>Apple's decision to go with an aluminum frame, which dissipates heats faster than one made from titanium, and a dedicated vapor chamber allow the A19 Pro chip to run faster and at a higher wattage. </p>



<p>For instance, as we covered recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/a19-pro-vs-a18-pro-vs-a17-pro-aaa-gaming-performance-comparison-up-to-69-percent-framerate-improvement/">the A19 Pro achieved 52.2FPS (6.1W) while playing Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, constituting a 56 percent improvement over the A18 Pro (4.7W), which only averaged 33.3FPS, and a 65 percent improvement over the A17 Pro (4.9W), which averaged 31.6FPS.</p>

<p>TSMC is currently in a 'chip supercycle,' as almost every supplier relies on the Taiwan chip giant for their semiconductor needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tsmc-faces-advanced-process-demand-to-an-extent-that-production-capacity-is-now-insufficient">TSMC Faces Advanced Process Demand To an Extent that Production Capacity Is Now "Insufficient"  </h2>



<p>The world is experiencing unprecedented chip demand driven by the advancements being made in the era of artificial intelligence. Almost every manufacturer, whether it is NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or even ASIC competitors like Broadcom and Marvell, is rushing to place orders with TSMC to secure capacity for their respective products. Now, based on <a href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251124700058-430501">what TSMC's CEO C.C. Wei has said at the occasion of SIA awards</a>, it is disclosed that the Taiwan chip giant currently sees demand that is "three-times' higher than what the firm can produce, which means that the semiconductor production bottleneck would last for several quarters ahead.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why TSMC experiences a constrained supply/demand situation is that the company is the sole supplier of 'advanced processes' that has managed to attract market spotlight. Sure, competitors like Intel and Samsung Foundry have their alternatives as well, but throughout the AI hype, we have only seen the processes by the Taiwan giant witnessing adoption. Nodes like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tsmcs-3nm-and-5nm-production-is-projected-to-be-100-booked-by-next-year/">the 5nm, 3nm, and beyond are claimed to be in massive demand</a>, driven by Big Tech, which is why TSMC's CEO says that advanced process capacity is "insufficient" on an enormous scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image wp-lightbox size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="728" height="406" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TSMC-3nm-2-728x406.jpg" alt="Rapidus semiconductor facility in Japan aiming for 2nm chip mass production by 2027 amid competition from TSMC and Samsung" class="wp-image-1612562" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TSMC-3nm-2-728x406.jpg 728w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TSMC-3nm-2-564x315.jpg 564w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TSMC-3nm-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<p>Even after the massive fab buildout, TSMC is still engaged in regions like Taiwan, the US, and Japan, and the firm still sees a shortfall, which isn't a small one at all. More importantly, since TSMC has long-term contracts with more mainstream companies like NVIDIA and Apple eventually account for a large portion of TSMC's total output, which means that others are facing a prolonged wait time for their semiconductor needs, which is why it won't be wrong to say that the whole AI supply chain is battling to place orders at the Taiwan chip giant.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how the semiconductor supply chain evolves moving ahead, especially since there's a lot of interest at TSMC, which is currently unable to fulfill. This does open up opportunities for companies like Intel and Samsung, but would Big Tech take the risk of placing chip orders with someone other than TSMC? Well, we'll have to wait and see for now.</p>

<p>Nearly a month after the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, former Creative Director and The Chinese Room Studio Head Dan Pinchbeck opened up on the game's development phase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWDyNLAo1E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with YouTuber Cat Burton</a>. </p>



<p>The most interesting tidbit is that Pinchbeck really didn't want to call this game Bloodlines 2. As you might recall, The Chinese Room only came in to rescue the game from cancellation after publisher Paradox Interactive split with the original developer of the sequel, Hardsuit Labs. That also meant they didn't have enough time or money to make it the true sequel fans of the original might have wanted. Apparently, it was Pinchbeck who decided to make it a more focused, Dishonored-like game, due to the constraints the developers were forced to work with.</p>



<p><em>We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2. That feels like the most important thing we do here, is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money. Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting. A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analyzed them. Great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. You couldn't get away with it now.</em></p>



<p><em>So, trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who love Bloodlines 1 happy and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2 and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money.</em></p>



<p><em>So we approached it from that point of view of, well, what can we do with the time and the money that's available, and at that point, I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make Dishonored.' We would look at something which is not an RPG and is not fully open world, but is really tightly focused and true to the mythos, and it's a good ride, we get a Bloodlines title out in the world, and then we'd started talking about saying, then what would the next big Bloodlines game look like after that, if that happened?</em></p>



<p>It's a sound strategy, in theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the game is going to sell enough to warrant a bigger, better sequel. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, only between 120K and 300K copies of the game have been sold so far via PC's most popular store. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I concluded that Bloodlines 2 is worth playing despite its flaws, but only for fans of the setting and once the game is significantly cheaper than the launch price. However, that might happen very soon.</p>

<p>Although it has provided some inspiration to The Witcher IV developer CD Projekt Red, future games from the studio won't be anything like Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-is-an-inspiration-for-cd-projekt-but-its-all-in-on-big-open-worlds-we-are-definitely-not-going-to-make-a-game-like-larian-did/">PC Gamer</a>, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 provided the developer a lot of inspiration, but they will still stick to the open-world setting seen in games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Obviously, CD Projekt Red isn't going to simply create similar games with better graphics, as Nowakowski highlighted that the studio wants to <em>"innovate."</em></p>



<p>Although the CD Projekt's joint CEO did not elaborate on how they plan to innovate their open-world formula in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, it seems that world interactivity will be enhanced over older games.</p>



<p><em>"That's the kind of game they can make,"</em> Michał Nowakowski said about Larian Studios' games like the Divinity: Original Sin series and Baldur's Gate 3. <em>"But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us."</em></p>



<p>Much of Baldur's Gate 3's success resides, in my opinion, exactly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">how the world feels incredibly dynamic and reactive</a>, so it's great to hear that The Witcher IV may take the best of Larian Studio's approach for the third entry in the beloved series and apply it to its open-world formula to improve the experience. As good as The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are, their open worlds adhere to traditional by-the-books design without shaking them up significantly, so I am very interested to see how much this influence will shape their sequels.</p>



<p>One thing The Witcher IV is not going to feature for certain is new contributions from Andrzej Sapkowski, author of the novels upon which the CDPR series is based. According to the author, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" class="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-have-any-new-contribution-from-andrzej-sapkowski/">the developer rarely asks him for details nowadays</a>, but their relationship remains healthy after <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/">the signing of a new deal in December 2019.</a></p>

<p>As Black Friday 2025 is still a few days away, some additional deals are expected to become available as we get closer to November 28.</p>

<p>Apple gets panned fairly regularly for supposedly being behind the curve on AI. Yet, it is Apple's broader AI architecture that is now being replicated by Samsung with a tie-up between Perplexity AI and Bixby.</p>



<p>If imitation is the highest form of flattery, Samsung just sang a literal paean in favor of its biggest competitor.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-samsung-will-integrate-perplexity-ai-with-its-bixby-voice-assistant-for-the-upcoming-galaxy-s26-series">Samsung will integrate Perplexity AI with its Bixby voice assistant for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Bixby will have Perplexity integrated into it. Basic tasks will be handled by Bixby while complicated, more thinking tasks will be backed by Perplexity. Just like how ChatGPT x Apple Intelligence works. Debut during the S26 series Unpacked very likely.</p>&mdash; Semi-retired-ing (@chunvn8888) <a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1992840567282360759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As per a tidbit from a fairly respectable tipster, who goes by the username "Semi-retired-ing" on X, Samsung's bespoke voice assistant, Bixby, will leverage Perplexity AI's models to handle the more complicated AI tasks, akin to what Apple already does with its Siri. This AI-focused tie-up is set to debut with the upcoming launch of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series early next year.</p>



<p>This approach suggests that Samsung is eschewing a foundational recalibration of Bixby, a task that would likely have been quite cost-prohibitive. Instead, the South Korean giant is now borrowing a leaf out of Apple's playbook by integrating Perplexity AI's very capable models with its in-house Bixby. Do note that Perplexity already gives Galaxy owners in the US <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/11825615-samsung-galaxy-perplexity-pro-12-months-free-for-u-s-galaxy-owners">up to 12 months of free subscription</a> to its premium tiers.</p>



<p>Of course, the move might also represent a gambit on Samsung's part to revive Bixby's fortunes on its smartphones, where Google's Gemini AI currently dominates. According to the evolving arrangement, Bixby is likely to handle relatively simple tasks, such as setting up an alarm or adjusting an internal setting. The more complex tasks, however, which include image generation, among others, will likely be handled by Perplexity AI's models.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-s-ai-playbook">Apple's AI playbook</h2>



<p>Apple Intelligence currently leverages its on-device models for relatively simple tasks, while relying on OpenAI's ChatGPT for the more complex ones. Yet, the iPhone manufacturer is revamping this strategy in the next few months. </p>



<p>We reported in early November that &nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri">Apple is planning to use a gigantic, albeit tailored, Gemini AI model to power its upcoming revamped Siri</a>. With 1.2 trillion parameters under its belt, the customized Gemini model would "dwarf" the 1.5 billion-parameter, bespoke AI model that Apple currently uses to power Siri in the cloud.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri">The Cupertino giant already tested OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude LLMs before settling on a customized version of Google's Gemini</a>&nbsp;to process the more complicated user requests that are to be offloaded to the cloud under Apple's Private Cloud Compute framework, where data is stripped of unique identifiers and anonymized to maintain user privacy.</p>



<p>What's more, Apple will reportedly pay Google around $1 billion per year to use Google's proprietary AI technology, forming merely the latest tranche in the ongoing transactional relationship between the two tech giants. After all,&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-dodged-a-20-billion-hit-thanks-to-google-antitrust-ruling-163056806.html">Google already pays Apple $20 billion per year</a>&nbsp;for ensuring default search engine privileges within the Safari browser and across other Apple services.</p>

<p>Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the indie single player first-person shooter game FEROCIOUS will be released on December 4 for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/?mc_cid=5e1f5669c5&amp;mc_eid=728a334a9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>FEROCIOUS, powered by Unity, is the debut game of OMYOG, a small studio that features the expertise of both AAA game and film veterans. Leonard Saalfrank, inspired by King Kong, leads the vision, while Mark, ex-Far Cry and Battlefront II director, brings sandbox-level design expertise. Writers like Jörg Ihle and Dominik Hochwald add narrative depth from film, games, and theme parks.</p>



<p>In FEROCIOUS, players will find themselves stranded on a dangerous island and forced to survive against mercenaries, dinosaurs, and a vibrant yet hostile ecosystem. At every turn, they must face challenges in the form of savage predators, treacherous terrain, and limited resources. Careful exploration is vital to uncover hidden paths, secrets and essential gear. Furthermore, as shown in the release date trailer (embedded below), there's a twist in that a so-called 'dino control device' lets you turn the dinosaurs to your side, so that they might be used to attack enemies, open paths, or infiltrate guarded areas. </p>



<p>The lore explanation is that it scans the creature's brain and reproduces its vocal signals, not unlike what was shown in Jurassic Park 3, but with the usage of ultrasonic calls that only the lizards can hear. Once scanned, the player can get a dinosaur to follow them, move to a particular spot, attack a target, break obstacles, or even fetch items. The commands depend on the species; some are more obedient (or smarter) than others. Not every dinosaur in the game will be controllable, though.</p>

<p>TinyBuild did not share the pricing yet, but given that it's an indie game, we expect it to be priced accordingly. The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for FEROCIOUS, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br /></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br />OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br />Processor: Intel Core i5 4th Gen or AMD equivalent<br />Memory: 12 GB RAM<br />Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br />DirectX: Version 11<br />Storage: 25 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br /></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br />OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br />Processor: Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5 3600 and up<br />Memory: 16 GB RAM<br />Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600<br />DirectX: Version 11<br />Storage: 25 GB available space</p>

<p>AMD has now issued a notification to its partners that it will raise the prices of its GPUs by at least 10% due to rising memory prices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rising-dram-prices-push-amd-to-raise-gpu-prices-by-at-least-10-all-major-suppliers-expect-to-increase-prices-in-the-coming-months">Rising DRAM Prices Push AMD To Raise GPU Prices By At Least 10%, All Major Suppliers Expect To Increase Prices In The Coming Months</h2>



<p>Well, it looks like <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-9070-now-available-at-msrps-599-549-us-heres-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD's Radeon RX 9000 GPUs falling back to their original MSRPs</a> was short-lived, as the chipmaker has notified its partners of its latest price increase, which affects its entire product lineup. UDN reports that AMD has now issued the notification to its partners and is expected to raise the prices by at least 10%.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Memory prices continue to rise, leading to a significant increase in graphics card costs. Industry sources indicate that AMD, the second-largest graphics card manufacturer, has notified its partners of a second price increase across its entire product line, with the increase estimated to be at least 10%.</p>



<p><a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/9158350?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via UDN</a></p>

<p>Earlier this month,<a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-amd-increase-gpu-prices-in-2026-rising-dram-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we had reported that both NVIDIA and AMD were planning to increase the prices of their GPUs</a>, especially the consumer-grade lineups, due to rising DRAM costs. Currently, NVIDIA, AMD &amp; Intel utilize GDDR ICs to power their consumer-grade graphics cards. NVIDIA leverages the latest GDDR7 memory while AMD and Intel leverage GDDR6 solutions, which, although not as performant as GDDR7, are cost-effective and allow the companies to offer higher VRAM offerings at a better value.</p>



<p>However, the current DRAM supply is very tight, and the consensus is that AI is to blame for all of that. The huge demand for DRAM in the AI segment has caused severe bottlenecks in the supply chain &amp; further adding to this are the DRAM suppliers who, instead of opening more production lines, have slashed down production, as per reports.</p>

<p>With a 10% price hike across AMD GPUs, it would mean that AMD's Radeon RX 9000 GPUs based on the latest RDNA 4 graphics architecture won't be available at MSRP at all. We only recently started seeing the prices drop back to the original MSRPs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/get-rx-9060-xt-16-for-just-339-and-8-gb-variant-for-249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and the current deals season has actually gotten them below MSRP</a>, but it looks like this will be the best chance for gamers to secure on card at a reasonable price before AMD and its partners are left with no other option but to raise the prices.</p>



<p>As per the report, major AMD suppliers and partners such as ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, etc, have been notified about the price increase, so expect higher prices on their products in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Following the mixed reception to its debut title, the free-to-play arena shooter game The Finals, Embark Studios returns stronger than ever with ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter title. Here's an overview of everything we know about this game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> before The Finals, during The Game Awards 2021. Back then, Embark conceived it as a free-to-play cooperative (PvE) third-person shooter game, but it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked to be a buy-to-play PvPvE game</a>. This, of course, meant a delay over the original plan. </p>



<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Embark finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final launch date: October 30, 2025. The game is available in two purchase options. The Standard Edition is priced at $39.99. For those seeking extras, a Deluxe Edition is offered at $59.99. This version of the game provides 2,400 Raider Tokens (used as in-game currency) as well as "The Wanderer" Pack, which includes the Valente Outfit, Pathfinder Backpack, and Blanket Roll. Inside the game, there are paid options for cosmetic-only purchases and battle pass-style content via Raider Tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly earlier, the final version of ARC Raiders is a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, with the devastated landscape specifically centered on the Italian coast. Humanity has been forced to retreat underground after a catastrophic event: an invasion by ARC units, mysterious mechanical enemies that descended from orbit in overwhelming numbers. The few survivors now huddle in the subterranean city of Toledo in the District of Speranza and surface only when necessary to scavenge and survive among the ruins above.</p>



<p>Arguably, what really sets ARC Raiders apart visually is its retro-futuristic vision, blending Cold War analog tech with advanced robotics and rich atmospheric detail. The world is streaked with neon, battered by fog and synth-heavy soundscapes, and every corner tells a story of a society that once was.</p>



<p>Just like most extraction shooters, ARC Raiders does not feature a traditional story campaign. The game does, however, include narrative bits that the players can discover through environmental clues, NPC interactions, and evolving background quests. Players are "Raiders," those few resourceful survivors that risk the dangers of the topside in search of loot (mechanically) and answers, such as what happened with the ARC invasion and the fate of Earth's vanished elite. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The core gameplay experience of ARC Raiders revolves around raiding, scavenging, and ultimately extracting. Each expedition on the surface is a tense, half-hour race against time, as players band together in squads of three or two players (although it is also possible to queue solo) to delve into dangerous zones, whose environments range from crumbling cities and derelict bunkers to the rusting debris of fallen spacecraft.</p>



<p>Players must carefully navigate the post-apocalyptic maps, being wary of both the hostile ARC robots and other human players who are also hunting the same vital resources. Tactics, aim, and squad coordination are essential, not least because at any moment a failed fight can mean the loss of everything not safely stored. The game’s extraction mechanic adds another strategic layer, requiring Raiders to find and reach specific extraction points before time—or luck—runs out. Extraction can be accomplished via elevators, metro stations, or secure hatches that require special keys and offer safer withdrawal, but each method presents its own risk and reward trade-offs.</p>



<p>The constant tension of loss and reward is what drives progression. Upon a successful extraction, teams return with valuable materials and equipment, which can be used to upgrade gear and base facilities for future runs. Anything not successfully extracted is, however, forfeit. Collaboration is therefore both supported and encouraged, as squads must rely on careful coordination to contend with unpredictable PvP encounters and environmental hazards, ranging from dynamic enemy spawns to changing weather and toxic zones. Notably, the game features a "Match Journey" system, which chronicles the story of each run.</p>

<p>The past few years have witnessed Apple adopt a typical launch timeline where it would unveil four top-end models targeting different pricing brackets. For 2026, the Cupertino firm is reported to take a different route, where the <a href="https://wccftech.com/base-iphone-18-getting-phased-out-apple-introducing-shake-up-next-year/">base model may not even be a part of the family</a>. Additionally, there are expected to be a multitude of changes and upgrades that we should look forward to, so if you haven’t picked up an iPhone 17 model this year and are patiently waiting for next year, here is our rumor roundup that covers everything you wanted to learn about the iPhone 18 series.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-we-witness-a-shake-up-launch-next-year-how-many-iphone-18-models-are-arriving-in-2026">Will we witness a shake-up launch next year? How many iPhone 18 models are arriving in 2026?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, the base model might not launch next year, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-upheaval-apple-to-launch-the-base-iphone-18-iphone-18e-and-the-iphone-air-2-in-the-spring-of-2027/">Apple announcing just three flagships</a>; the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/apple-iphone-fold-launch-price-features-specifications-roundup/">iPhone Fold</a>. Based on this launch schedule, the base iPhone 18, which, according to an Omdia senior researcher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-sticking-with-iphone-20-name-in-2027-says-senior-researcher/">will be called the iPhone 20 instead</a>, is expected to find a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-to-proceed-with-iphone-17e-and-iphone-18e-launch/">place alongside the iPhone 18e</a> in early 2027.</p>



<p>As for the iPhone Air 2 successor, due to virtually no demand for the first-generation iPhone Air, Apple is said to delay its upcoming sleek flagship to 2027. Assuming the technology giant maintains the same prices as this year, the iPhone 18 series could start from an expensive $1,099, but these high figures should matter little because Apple’s premium models have always made up the bulk of its annual shipments.</p>



<p>Only this time, we will be greeted by the world’s first foldable iPhone, and based on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-foldable-iphone-to-lack-face-id-specifications-finalized-this-year-high-price-expected/">pricing estimates</a>, the iPhone 18 Pro will appear like a value-oriented product. Fortunately, the arrival of the newer models should make the iPhone 17 a more salivating alternative, and it shouldn’t be surprising that carriers and online retailers start offering the latter at insanely attractive discounts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-and-display">Design and display</h2>



<p>The iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are rumored to retain the same display sizes as their immediate predecessors, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-17-pro-max-aluminum-a19-camera-upgrades/">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, with tipster Digital Chat Station claiming that both flagships will <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-18-pro-max-display-sizes-revealed-with-punch-hole-cutout-instead-of-pill-shape/">ship with a punch-hole front-facing camera</a>&nbsp;instead of a pill-shaped cutout, indicating that the Face ID components will be embedded underneath the OLED panel.</p>



<p>The same tipster also mentions that these devices will <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-18-pro-same-screen-size-but-different-rear-design-claims-rumor/">sport a slightly transparent rear glass</a>, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max featuring vapor chamber cooling to effectively dissipate heat. There was also a third claim from this person, stating that these handsets will <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-eyeing-a-uniform-aesthetic-for-the-iphone-18-by-abandoning-the-rear-two-tone-look/">ditch the rear two-tone aesthetic</a>&nbsp;and switch to a more uniform paint job. As for the dimensions, only the iPhone 18 Pro Max has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-iphone-18-pro-max-tipped-to-be-the-most-obese-ever/">tipped to be thicker and heavier than any iPhone released before it</a>.</p>



<p>This change suggests that Apple could incorporate a beefier cooling solution and a potentially bigger battery than the unit present in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. While this means a higher endurance rating for the iPhone 18 Pro Max, it will be at the expense of your arm getting tired faster. Apple is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-exploring-high-mobility-oxide-displays-to-succeed-ltpo-improve-iphone-efficiency/">exploring ‘High Mobility Oxide’ (HMO) display technology</a>, which will serve as the successor to LTPO OLED panels.</p>



<p>Samsung has been reported to <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-ltpo-successor-high-mobility-oxide-displays-found-a-manufacturer/">begin mass production sometime</a> in 2026, with these displays reducing power consumption while also being less expensive to manufacture. Sadly, there is no indication of whether these panels will be adopted by the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-rumored-iphone-18-hardware-specifications">Other rumored iPhone 18 hardware specifications</h2>



<p>The most notable internal upgrades arriving to the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/apple-a20-pro-first-iphone-2nm-chipsets-here-is-everything-you-need-to-know/">Apple’s A20 and A20 Pro chipsets</a>. These will be the company’s first 2nm SoCs, though it is likely that only the A20 Pro will launch next year for the three flagships, with the A20 being reserved for the iPhone 20 in 2027. Given that Apple launched three A19 chipsets this year, we’re inclined to believe that it will <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-launching-three-a20-chipsets-for-iphone-18-in-2026/">retain this practice in 2026</a>, with the following configurations expected to be present in each iPhone.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>iPhone 18 Pro</strong> - A20 Pro (2 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores, 5-core GPU)</li>



<li><strong>iPhone 18 Pro Max</strong> - A20 Pro (2 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores, 6-core GPU)</li>



<li><strong>iPhone Fold</strong> - A20 Pro (2 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores, 6-core GPU)</li>
</ul>



<p>This could be the first time that Apple introduces a lower-binned A20 Pro to the iPhone 18 Pro, with the most premium members shipping with the fastest variant. Other internals can include the newer C2 5G modem, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-c2-5g-modem-rumored-to-be-in-development/">development started earlier this year</a>&nbsp;and could be Apple’s first baseband chip to support mmWave networks. However, unlike the A20 and A20 Pro, the C2 is reported to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-c2-to-be-mass-produced-on-older-tsmc-process-says-report/">mass produced on TSMC’s older 4nm process</a>.</p>



<p>As for the memory, Apple is not rumored to adopt LPDDR6 RAM, leaving it an entire generation behind Qualcomm, which is said to adopt this standard for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-6-specifications-features-launch-roundup/">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 Pro</a>. However, the company could <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-18-to-use-six-channel-ram-to-boost-performance-and-bandwidth/">switch to six-channel LPDDR5X memory</a>, resulting in higher bandwidth and performance, both of which will be necessary for boosting on-device AI capabilities.</p>



<p>As for the RAM count, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that if Apple can resolve the chip shortage problem, all iPhone 18 models could <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-iphone-18-models-to-feature-12gb-ram-apple-running-into-iphone-17-supply-problems/">ship with 12GB memory as standard</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-camera">Camera</h2>



<p>Tetraprism zoom capabilities debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro Max, with Apple slowly introducing more and more camera features to the lineup. Variable aperture is the next addition that is rumored to <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-bringing-variable-aperture-technology-to-the-iphone-18-not-every-model-will-feature-it/">arrive exclusively to the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max</a>. This technology will adjust the aperture values depending on the surrounding light, with a separate rumor claiming that the 48MP telephoto camera will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-18-pro-48mp-telephoto-camera-to-get-larger-aperture-new-launch-schedule/">treated to a wider aperture</a>.</p>



<p>Given that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max have an F/2.2 aperture for the telephoto unit, an F/2.0 aperture could be targeted for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. Apple is also rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-working-on-in-house-100mp-with-lofic-but-not-expected-for-a-few-years/">exploring a 100MP in-house sensor</a> with a Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor (LOFIC), but it is not expected to debut in next year’s models.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-battery">Battery</h2>



<p>There’s no word on the battery capacity for either the iPhone 18 Pro or iPhone 18 Pro Max, but the latter’s increase in thickness and weight can hint that the flagship will be treated to a bigger cell. The iPhone Fold is rumored to be tested with a capacity in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iphone-fold-battery-capacity-to-be-higher-than-iphone-17-pro-max/">5,400-5,800mAh range</a>, so there’s a possibility that Apple brings larger batteries to the entire lineup. As for silicon-carbon technology, we don’t believe the trillion-dollar firm is willing to take that bet yet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-price">Price</h2>



<p>The estimates for the newest lineup cover the iPhone Fold only, but given that Apple just introduced a price bump to the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the iPhone 18 could start from $1,099.</p>



<div class="dem-poll-shortcode"><div id="democracy-1481" class="democracy" data-opts='{"ajax_url":"https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","pid":1481,"max_answs":0,"answs_max_height":"500","anim_speed":"400","line_anim_speed":1500}' ><strong class="dem-poll-title">Which iPhone 18 will you upgrade to next year?</strong><div class="dem-screen vote"><form method="POST" action="#democracy-1481"><ul class="dem-vote"><li data-aid="6461">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-launch">Launch</h2>



<p>Every year for the past several years, Apple has consistently held its iPhone launch event in September. We don’t see that changing, but we should expect the base iPhone 18 to be excluded from the announcements, as it could materialize as the iPhone 20 in the first quarter of 2027.</p>

<p>Full details of Intel's W890 platform, designed for the upcoming Granite Rapids Workstation CPUs, have leaked out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-w890-platform-to-support-up-to-350w-granite-rapids-workstation-cpus-96-pcie-gen5-amp-16-gen4-lanes">Intel W890 Platform To Support Up To 350W Granite Rapids Workstation CPUs, 96 PCIe Gen5 &amp; 16 Gen4 Lanes</h2>



<p>Intel's Granite Rapids Workstation CPUs, which will be part of the next-gen Xeon-WS family, are right around the corner. We recently covered some <a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xeon-654-granite-rapids-workstation-cpu-leak-18-cores-preliminary-lineup-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preliminary lineup specs here</a> and even got to see the flagship chip in action, <a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-granite-rapids-xeon-workstation-cpu-leak-86-cores-172-threads-w890-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offering 86 cores and 172 threads</a>.</p>



<p>Now, we have more details regarding the W890 platform, which will be powering these upcoming WS CPUs. The W890 platform is based around the E2 Socket (LGA 4710), which will be featured on both Expert and Mainstream segments. The socket supports CPUs with up to 350W TDPs, &amp; up to 16 P-Cores.</p>



<p>While Intel has been getting close to AMD's Threadripper in terms of core count, the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-9000-cpus-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Threadripper 9000 chips</a>&nbsp;still offer 12% more cores (96 vs 86). Furthermore, Zen 5 is a very efficient architecture, so it will be interesting to see how the next-gen Intel Xeon Workstation fares against the competition. AMD's CPUs also offer 80-128 PCIe Gen 5 lanes, up to 384 MB of cache, and up to 350W TDPs. So it looks like the fight is going to be really close.</p>

<p>The Intel Granite Rapids Workstation Xeon CPUs will support both standard DDR5 DIMMs and RDIMMs. The RDIMMs support will include speeds of up to 5200 MT/s and up to 2 TB capacities that operate in quad-channel mode (2DPC configuration).</p>



<p>In terms of PCIe lanes, the Expert CPUs will carry a total of 112 PCIe lanes, of which 96 will be Gen5 and 16 will be Gen4 lanes. The Mainstream platform will carry a total of 80 PCIe Gen5 lanes &amp; no Gen4 PCIe lanes. The CPUs will be connected to the W890 chipset using a Gen4 x8 lane DMI interface. The PCH is also feature-rich, offering:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1 x Intel Ethernet Controller I226-V (2.5 GbE LAN)</li>



<li>9 x USB 2.0/1.1 Links</li>



<li>10 x USB 3.2 Links</li>



<li>8 x SATA III Links</li>



<li>2 x SlimSAS Links (PCIe Gen4x4 Each)</li>



<li>Server IPMC ASPEED AST2600 Controller</li>



<li>Nuvoton NCT6126D</li>
</ul>



<p>The platform will receive power through a single 24-pin ATX connector and up to four 8-pin ATX connectors to feed the 350W base TDP of Intel's Granite Rapids Xeon Workstation CPUs. </p>



<p>Overall, Intel's W890 looks to be a very feature-rich platform, and should offer decent capabilities against the AMD Threadripper 9000 family is positioned well in terms of value and performance. We expect to see a launch next year, with a possible unveil planned for CES 2026, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has now contradicted earlier reporting by Reuters and the Financial Times, disclosing that Apple's incumbent CEO, Tim Cook, is not going away anytime soon, despite the impression given by the recent reports.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mark-gurman-apple-ceo-tim-cook-isn-t-retiring-imminently">Mark Gurman: "Apple CEO Tim Cook isn’t retiring imminently"</h2>



<p>As we noted earlier this week, Reuters and the Financial Times have both reported recently that <a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-era-of-stagnation-likely-to-end-as-tim-cook-prepares-to-depart">Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, was likely to step down next year</a> after well over a decade at the helm of one of the largest corporate behemoths in the world.</p>



<p>According to the Financial Times, even though&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0d424625-f4f8-4646-9f6e-927c8cbe0e3e">Apple's board had already initiated the search for a new CEO</a>, it was unlikely to announce Cook's replacement before Apple's next quarterly earnings announcement, due in January 2026. </p>



<p>Even so, according to the Financial Times, Apple was likely to have a new CEO before its developer conference in June, with the VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, currently being perceived as the favored frontrunner to replace Tim Cook.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple CEO Tim Cook isn’t retiring imminently, with recent reports on him stepping down in the first half of next year simply being premature. Here are the facts in the latest Power On: <a href="https://t.co/f2YNQG845y">https://t.co/f2YNQG845y</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1992580360866250824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Now, however, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has directly contradicted the earlier reporting by Reuters and the Financial Times, noting that "Tim Cook isn't retiring immediately."</p>



<p>According to Gurman, Tim Cook is likely to continue as Apple's CEO at least through the current US Presidency. This means Cook is slated to remain at the helm of the tech giant until at least 2028. Of course, by that time, Cook would have turned 70. Do note that Cook has <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-surpasses-steve-jobs-as-the-longest-running-chief-executive/">already surpassed Steve Jobs to become Apple's longest-serving CEO</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Gurman also believes that Ternus would be the most logical choice to replace Tim Cook once he does end up departing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-s-talent-bleed-continues-unabated">Apple's talent bleed continues unabated</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OpenAI’s new hardware division built around Jony Ive’s secretive startup has ramped up hiring of Apple engineers. The group has brought on about 40 new people in the last month or so, with many of them coming from Apple’s hardware group. Details here: <a href="https://t.co/f2YNQG845y">https://t.co/f2YNQG845y</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1992581471954198974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Apple appears to be bleeding talent left, right, and center, and not just in the highly competitive AI space. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-will-no-longer-have-any-say-in-openais-upcoming-apple-iphone-killer-consumer-device-decisions">the tech giant's core iPhone design team is also bleeding talent to Jony Ive's io</a>, which was recently acquired by OpenAI in its quest for an "iPhone Killer" device, to be packaged in a screenless, pocket-sized form factor.</p>



<p>According to Gurman, OpenAI has hired around 40 Apple engineers in the last month or so alone! <a href="https://wccftech.com/openai-and-jony-ive-recruit-top-apple-talent-tap-key-suppliers-to-build-next-gen-ai-hardware">Some of these prominent hires from Apple include Matt Theobald</a>, a manufacturing design expert, and Cyrus Daniel Irani, the lead on human interface design.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This comes as Abidur Chowdhury, the designer of the iPhone Air and a rising star within Apple, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-cant-seem-to-retain-innovators-iphone-air-designer-departs-for-greener-pastures">has also left his cushy job with the Cupertino giant&nbsp;to pursue a stint at an unnamed AI startup</a>.</p>

<p>Intel's Johnson City platform, which is designed for reference evaluation of the next-gen Diamond Rapids "Xeon" CPUs, has been spotted at NBD's shipment database. The latest information offers us some new information on what the upcoming processors have on offer.</p>



<p>The shipment log reveals the JNC Server Board hardware and labels it as "Validation Material". JNC stands for Johnson City, which is being used by Intel and its partners to evaluate the performance, capabilities, and features of the upcoming Diamond Rapids processors for next-gen Xeon platforms.</p>

<p>There aren't many details provided, but two listings reveal a "1SPC 500 DMR" which could point to a 500W TDP range for the Diamond Rapids CPUs, while the other lists a 650W TDP. In another listing, a JNC Multi-S platform is listed, which is numbered 2+1+1S. 1S refers to a single-socket solution, but this could likely be a label for a multi-socket or a multi-chiplet Diamond Rapids configuration.</p>



<p>As per previous information, Intel's Diamond Rapids "Xeon" CPUs are expected to feature up to 192 cores, and some rumors even point to up to 256 cores, though Intel hasn't confirmed a lot of details yet. We know that the chips are expected to utilize the latest 18A process node, and the core architecture is going to be <a class="dracula-style-link dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-next-gen-diamond-rapids-xeon-cpus-panther-cove-x-p-cores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Panther Cove P-Cores</a>.</p>



<p>It was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-ditches-8-channel-diamond-rapids-xeon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently reported that Diamond Rapids "Xeon 7" CPUs will only come in 16-channel flavors</a>, meaning that the mainstream 8-channel platforms are being canned, but there might be some logical reasons to go that route. After Diamond Rapids, Intel is going to launch Coral Rapids "Xeon" CPUs, which are going to bring back SMT support as revealed by Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, himself.</p>

<p>Intel Diamond Rapids processors will use a massive <a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-diamond-rapids-ap-xeon-cpus-massive-lga-9324-socket-oak-stream-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LGA 9324 socket</a>, almost 5 times bigger than the LGA 1700. It will be even bigger than the Granite Rapids, which will utilize the LGA 7529 socket. Many of the specifications of the Diamond Rapids are still unknown, and Intel has yet to reveal its release date. However, it's expected that Diamond Rapids will launch sometime in 2026 (2H likely) and will compete against <a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-zen-6-cpus-over-70-percent-performance-efficiency-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD's EPYC Venice</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Power On: After the iOS 26 overhaul, Apple’s plan for iOS 27 is a Snow Leopard-like year with a major focus on quality versus new features. But there’s one big exception: a lot more AI. Details here — <a href="https://t.co/f2YNQG845y">https://t.co/f2YNQG845y</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1992579526635983040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to Bloomberg's legendary tipster, Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8">Apple's upcoming iOS 27 software update won't have any new shiny features</a>, with the Cupertino giant expected to focus on improving the operating system's underlying stability.</p>



<p>This would be the first time since iOS 12 that Apple would focus on subtle improvements rather than dazzling its users with new features. According to Gurman, these subtle undertones would extend to Apple's other operating systems as well, including macOS 27, iPadOS 27, tvOS 27, etc.</p>



<p>Gurman believes Apple engineers would focus on cutting bloat, eliminating bugs, and meaningfully boosting the overall stability and efficiency of the tech giant's various operating systems, akin to what Apple did with the Mac OS X version 10.6, which was officially dubbed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/aug/27/snow-leopard-review">Snow Leopard update</a>. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ios-27-will-transform-the-apple-iphone-into-a-telehealth-powerhouse">Apple is expected to introduce some new AI features</a> with iOS 27, including:</p>



<p><strong>A visual redesign for the Siri voice assistant</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apple's Siri voice assistant is slated to receive a visual overhaul with iOS 27, replete with a Finder icon-like avatar. Along with Siri's improved contextual understanding as part of the upcoming iOS 26.4 update, the visual overhaul would allow users to hold more natural back-and-forth conversations with the voice assistant. </li>
</ol>



<p><strong>An AI-powered web search tool</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apple is working on unlocking a new AI-powered search experience, dubbed internally as World Knowledge Answers. The feature would allow Siri to provide summarized answers to general user queries by leveraging a hefty database of knowledge, reducing the voice assistant's reliance on traditional link-based search results.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>A revamped Health app</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apple's Health+ service is expected to offer personalized, AI-powered health coaching, with a curated list of helpful videos from health experts to explain various health conditions and offer guidance on lifestyle improvements. The service will also offer a nutrition tracking feature.</li>
</ol>



<p>This comes as Apple is planning to <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-will-use-a-1-2-trillion-parameter-very-expensive-ai-model-from-google-as-a-crutch-for-siri">use a gigantic, albeit tailored, Gemini AI model to power its upcoming revamped Siri in the cloud</a>. With 1.2 trillion parameters under its belt, the customized Gemini model would "dwarf" the 1.5 billion-parameter, bespoke AI model that Apple currently uses to power Siri in the cloud. Apple will pay Google around $1 billion per year to use Google's proprietary AI technology.</p>

<p>I then noticed the bottom of the cart button saying “See it in store…closest store with a demo model on display,” so I made plans to go out when they opened the following morning to see if Best Buy would sell it to me. Gamers, we fuckin’ got it. $370.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p4gl38/thank_you_pcmr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditor</a> was quite lucky to get this system for just $370, even when the PC was sold out. Essentially, he visited his Best Buy local store, where he saw the same PC, featuring an Intel Core i7 14700F processor paired with the powerful mid-range GPU, GeForce RTX 4070 12 GB, and 32 GB DDR5/ 2 TB SSD configuration. The system easily costs over $1200 right now, and considering many DDR5 32 GB RAM kits are now available for $300, he just saved nearly $900 on this one. </p>

<p>For less than $400, this is probably the deal of the decade, and it can run almost all the latest triple-A titles on max graphical presets. While Best Buy displayed it as a demo model, it seems like they had more than one sample for this configuration. It's unknown why this particular system saw such a huge price drop, but such discounts are rare, and we are totally not jealous of the guy :P.</p>



<p>That said, even if you can't find such amazing PC deals, you can surely check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/deals/">our latest deals posts</a>, which will save you some good cash.

<p>AMD's Zen 6 is still far away from its official launch, but MSI is already preparing for the upcoming CPUs by releasing motherboards with larger BIOS capacity.</p>

<p>MSI has already officially announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/msi-meg-x870e-godlike-x-edition-x870e-amd-am5-max-motherboards-ryzen-cpus-oc-engine-64-mb-bios-upgraded-designs/">some of these motherboard models</a> at Computex, but hasn't prepared the webpages for these products yet. We did know specs for these, but now we have detailed specs, including the B850 chipset model, thanks to <a class="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/wxnod/status/1992226688261062917">wxnod</a>. One is a B850 chipset model and the rest three are X870E boards, which are reportedly Zen 6 "ready". </p>

<p>We have the MSI MAG B850M Mortar Max WiFi as likely the cheapest option here, offering 64 MB BIOS to support "next-level" CPU upgrades with "better" compatibility. This could indicate support for Ryzen 9000G APUs as well as Zen 6-based SKUs coming next year. The motherboard boasts quite identical features to the MAG B850M Mortar WiFi, but has an additional M.2 slot. The layout also seems identical, and the I/O is unchanged as well. Another new feature is the introduction of the OC Engine for improved gaming performance, which will be available on other MAX models as well.</p>

</figure>



<p>Next, we have the X870E lineup, which now offers three MAX models, bringing 64 MB BIOS chips as well. We cannot spot any differences in the design of these compared to their non-MAX variants, and they will all boast modern connectivity, the same number of PCIe x16 slots, M.2 ports, memory support, and features. They do offer OC Engine as we talked about previously, and EZ DIY design.</p>



<p>It's unusual to see motherboard manufacturers revising their existing lineups with a bigger BIOS chip, considering we only have two generations of CPUs compatible with the AM5 socket. Even the Ryzen 9000G will be based on the Zen 5 architecture, and shouldn't need an additional 32 MB space, as the default 32 MB BIOS chip is sufficient to accommodate a few CPU lineups. Even though MSI is preparing 64 MB BIOS models, the default <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-zen-6-reportedly-wont-drop-support-for-existing-am5-motherboards-with-32-mb-bios/">32 MB should still be okay for supporting Zen 6</a> without dropping the support for older generations. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/"><img width="728" height="374" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam_Machine_Closeup-HD-728x374.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="A Steam Machine with a white LED light strip is placed on a wooden table next to a pair of safety glasses." decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam_Machine_Closeup-HD-728x374.jpeg 728w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam_Machine_Closeup-HD-564x290.jpeg 564w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam_Machine_Closeup-HD-1456x748.jpeg 1456w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam_Machine_Closeup-HD-1920x987.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the new Steam Machine</a> from earlier this month led many to believe that Valve was making a direct play against the console market, trying to capture some of the loyal users who have followed PlayStation and Xbox platforms for generations.</p>



<p>However, there's one key aspect that might very well prevent that from happening: price. At first, speculation was that Valve would have subsidized the hardware, similar to what Sony and Microsoft have been doing with their PlayStation and Xbox consoles. This means accepting a loss on every unit sold, counting on the fact that the real profit comes with selling games and accessories. </p>



<p>Valve could have done the same thing, as they also receive a 30% cut on sales from the Steam store, and they sell accessories and other hardware that will be compatible with the Steam Machine, such as the new Steam Controller and the Steam Frame Virtual Reality headset. However, it doesn't appear that they are planning to move forward with this strategy.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">We got <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">our first inkling when Valve's Hardware Engineer, Yazan Aldehayyat,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/" target="_blank">stated</a>&nbsp;that the product's pricing would be 'really competitive' compared to</span> building a similar PC at home.</span> That sounded like it won't be too far off from just purchasing the regular PC components yourself. Then, Linus Tech Tips <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-unlikely-to-hit-the-500-console-mark-but-you-shouldnt-be-surprised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that, after mentioning a potential $500 price point for the Steam Machine in a room with Valve employees, the 'energy wasn't great', suggesting it was unlikely to happen.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber SkillUp</a> flat-out asked the question, and the answer from Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais was a straight no:</p>



<p><em><strong>[....] But it's not going to be a sort of subsidized device, like, Valve is not going into this thinking we're going to eat a big loss on this so that we can grow market share or category or anything like that, correct?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Pierre-Loup Griffais:</em></strong> <em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is. But also some integration features like HDMI CEC. The Bluetooth and wireless work that we've done, the four antennas, the very deliberate design so that you can have a great experience with four Bluetooth controllers.   </em></p>



<p>Without subsidization, and with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored RAM price hike from Samsung</a>, the Steam Machine might end up costing between $800 and $900. At that price point, it would be honestly a difficult sell to most console users when the PlayStation 5, which launched in 2020 and is priced at $499 (right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Digital Edition is actually down to $399 for the duration of the Black Friday sale</a>), is reportedly slightly more powerful.</p>



<p>As a reminder, here's the full spec sheet from Valve.</p>

<p>The CXMT DDR5 memory comes in 16 Gb and 24 Gb densities, and features speeds of up to 8000 MT/s. The company laid out a full spectrum of products that will deploy this DRAM UDIMM, SODIMM, RDIMM, CSODIMM, CUDIMM, and TFF MRDIMM. Each of these products will leverage the CXMT DDR5 ICs, &amp; will target all types of market segments such as Data Centers, Desktop PCs, Laptops, etc. </p>



<p>CXMT also showed its DDR5 ICs being utilized by ASGARD, a memory module manufacturer. These gaming memory kits are said to operate at much higher OC speeds. <a href="https://wccftech.com/asgard-thor-ddr5-9600-mtps-cudimm-memory-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASGARD was one of the first module makers to unveil CUDIMM DDR5 for the market</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to DDR5, CXMT also unveiled its LPDDR5X products, which will include 12 Gb and 16 Gb densities. The chips will operate at up to 10,667 MT/s. The densities enable 12 GB, 16 GB, 24 GB, and 32GB capacities. These modules are aimed at laptops and embedded platforms, but also serve a purpose in the AI markets.</p>

<p>CXMT's DDR5 also debuts at a very interesting time when global DRAM suppliers are unable to meet the huge demand from the AI segment, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/within-three-months-samsung-ddr5-5600-16-gb-module-price-rose-by-3x-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">severe price increases across the market</a>. With its own DDR5 production, China will be able to reduce its reliance on overseas manufacturers and will be able to provide a stable supply to its domestic consumers.</p>

<p>The unique liquid cooling solution belonging to the REDMAGIC 11 Pro allows the <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-officially-announces-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5/">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>&nbsp;to comfortably stretch its legs and allows for higher sustained performance when using the flagship smartphone exclusively for gaming. However, cramming in the ‘top of the line’ specifications and calling it a day will hardly set a company apart from the competition, which is why REDMAGIC has incorporated two important gaming features that we believe its rivals should adopt in the shortest time possible; frame generation and AI upscaling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toggling-the-two-settings-when-playing-games-on-the-redmagic-11-pro-will-result-in-higher-temperatures-which-is-why-it-is-necessary-for-manufacturers-to-pay-extra-attention-to-the-cooling">Toggling the two settings when playing games on the REDMAGIC 11 Pro will result in higher temperatures, which is why it is necessary for manufacturers to pay extra attention to the cooling</h2>



<p>When playing Wuthering Waves on the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, Dame Tech noticed that the game offers the option to enhance image quality using AI upscaling, while also boosting the framerate using interpolation, or in other words, frame generation. REDMAGIC has incorporated these features using proprietary software, which helps increase gaming performance substantially.</p>



<p>The content creator claims that after enabling these two features, Wuthering Waves feels less like an Android game and more like a PC or PS5 title. In supported titles, enabling NVIDIA’s Frame Generation is a game-changer, so we share Dame Tech’s enthusiasm on this subject. Sadly, despite chipsets like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-officially-announces-snapdragon-8-elite/">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dimensity-9400-has-officially-launched/">Dimensity 9400</a> are capable of playing visually impressive games through emulation, but manufacturers are still sleeping on bringing the aforementioned features to their devices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playing Wuthering Waves on the REDMAGIC 11 PRO feels like a totally different game with frame gen (120 FPS) and image upscaling enabled via their proprietary built-in software. It doesn’t feel like the mobile version but instead what you see on PC or PS5! Their gaming features… <a href="https://t.co/2NC2RAdhNe">pic.twitter.com/2NC2RAdhNe</a></p>&mdash; Dame Tech (@DameTechChannel) <a href="https://twitter.com/DameTechChannel/status/1992344100209877381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In the image above, REDMAGIC warns that the features require more CPU and GPU processing, which will increase temperatures, but that is what the sophisticated liquid cooling is for. To be honest, companies should start broadly experimenting with bringing similar heat dissipation solutions, as vapor chambers are reaching their thermal limits.</p>



<p>For instance, take a look at the OnePlus 15, another device that caters to mobile gamers with its 165Hz display. Unfortunately, its vapor chamber cannot hold off the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5’s power-guzzling attributes because, when running 3DMark Wild Life Extreme, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oneplus-15-overheats-when-running-3dmark-wild-life-extreme-app-crashes/">benchmark crashed due to overheating</a>. We don’t expect Samsung to transition to REDMAGIC 11 Pro’s solution with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but we certainly hope to see some initiative next year; otherwise, mobile gaming will reach a plateau.</p>
