                    nothing to do with a Cease Fire,” and claimed it was something “Much bigger than

                    some parts of the city—including the main compound of Iran’s state broadcaster,

                    Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi signaled he was open to talks resuming
                    talks with the U.S. if Israel’s strikes on Iran were halted. “If President Trump
                    is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are
                    consequential. Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of
                    military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone
                    call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for
                    a return to diplomacy,” he wrote. The post also attacked Israeli Prime Minister
                    Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him a “war criminal.”</p>

                <p>This cohort goes by many names: <em>influencer</em> is the most popular, <em>
                    creators</em> the most respectful, <em>streamers</em> or vloggers the most dated
                    and narrow. Here’s the most accurate term: <em>entrepreneurs</em>. Creators
                    succeed based on their own talents and hard work, with little given to them.
                    They build audiences, hire staff, cut equity deals. In doing so, they’ve ended
                    the era of studio bosses and super-agents as the gatekeepers of fame and
                    fortune. Self-destiny now rules: Anyone can be a star if their product is good
                    enough, and they’ll own the content, too. </p>
                <p>That’s why <em>Forbes</em>, as the voice of entrepreneurship, covers this group
                    so urgently. “This is more than selling other people’s products,” says <a

                    Question: How Will This Impact The Market?</h2>
                <p>Experts told Forbes that the most recent data indicates consumers are becoming
                    more uneasy as potential tariffs and international conflict increase volatility
                    in the market. “While household balance sheets remain healthy, consumers are
                    growing more cautious and increasingly selective with their spending amid
                    lingering policy uncertainty, deteriorating labor market prospects and tariff
                    anxiety,” Bossour said. The EY-Parthenon economist predicted a “sharp
                    deceleration in spending” the rest of the year before beginning to recover in
                    2026. “The US consumer has kept economic growth going despite the tariff threats
                    and trade disruptions,” Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer at
                    Northlight Asset Management, told Forbes in emailed comments. “If the consumer
                    begins to rollover, then it could lead to layoffs and a vicious cycle of slower
                    spending and higher unemployment.” Zaccarelli said his firm remained cautious,
                    with factors like the pending trade deals with China and the European Union, as
                    well as the escalating conflict in Iran, potentially impacting the market in the
                    near future. However, Zaccarelli also said that this month’s decline could still
                    be a “one-off.” Removing spending on cars and gasoline, overall retail spending
                    has only declined one month out of the year so far.</p>

                <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested he would “probably” extend a deadline
                    for ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based owners, to divest the social media app
                    before Thursday, marking what would be his third delay after an earlier deal

                    We Don’t Know</h2>
                <p>How long Trump would delay TikTok’s deadline. Both extensions in January and
                    April stalled a ban on TikTok by 75 days. It’s also unclear whether Trump can
                    continue delaying TikTok’s ban. John Acevedo, a law professor at Emory
                    University, <a

                        title="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2025/04/18/trump-tiktok-china-tariffs-">
                    argued</a> Trump could continue to delay enforcing legislation for TikTok’s ban
                    through executive orders, though he could be forced to allow the ban if
                    challenged by Congress or a court. Under the bill, Trump has the power to delay
                    the ban for up to 90 days if there is “significant progress” toward a deal. </p>

                <p>The Federal Reserve’s meeting deciding whether or not to lower interest rates
                    this month kicked off Tuesday, and though it’s highly unlikely the summit will
                    produce the rate cuts President Donald Trump has aggressively pushed for, it
                    will reveal how the U.S.’ top monetary policymakers are approaching the U.S.
                    economy as tariffs play out.</p>

                    To Watch For</h2>
                <p>Beyond any potential fireworks from Powell amid the Trump barrage directed at
                    him, the most critical update from this week’s Fed conclave will be the release
                    of its quarterly summary of economic projections, or dot plot. That will reveal
                    where Fed staff expect several key economic data points to head in the near
                    future, notably indicating the median expectation for rate cuts from the
                    policymakers who vote on conducting them. The March dot plot indicated the Fed’s
                    baseline forecast was for two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but this month’s
                    update will reveal just one expected cut in 2025, according to Bank of America
                    forecasts. </p>

                    Trump’s tariffs. To that end, Goldman Sachs economists expect inflation to rise
                    from its most recent 2.5% to 3.3% by December, according to the Fed’s preferred
                    inflation measure of core personal consumption expenditures. Goldman expects the
                    dot plot to also reveal the Fed expects to see higher unemployment (four-year
                    high of 4.5%) and lower economic growth (1.3% real gross domestic product
                    growth), though the investment bank does expect the Fed to stand by its
                    projection of two 2025 cuts. </p>
                <h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">How
                    Will Stocks React To Fed Meeting?</h2>
                <p>Fed meetings often bring significant movements in stock prices, and the stakes
                    are set this week for a potential move. Generally, stocks tend to rise when the
                    Fed indicates rates will go lower and fall on the reverse, as public companies
                    fetch higher valuations on stronger profit margins from lower borrowing costs
                    and stocks becoming more attractive for investors as fixed income returns
                    shrink. If the Fed adjusts its dot plot to indicate just one 2025 cut, that
                    would cause a noticeable selloff in stocks, according to Sevens Report founder
                    Tom Essaye, predicting a roughly 1% drop for the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index.
                    Should the Fed maintain its median forecast of two cuts, Essaye said he expects
                    a mild rally, though that could expand into a sizable gain if Powell shows
                    openness to lowering rates at the July meeting. The FedWatch Tool shows just a
                    13% chance of a cut at the July 29-30 summit. </p>

                        <strong>Accessibility 100</strong>
                    </a> list,
                    highlighting the biggest innovators and impact-makers in the field of
                    accessibility for people with disabilities. The companies featured on this list
                    are changing the world of accessibility – big tech companies that made the list,
                    like Apple and Google, specialize in devices that introduce new and vital
                    accessibility features year over year. Other list makers are lesser known
                    companies and individuals whose innovations are transforming how people with a
                    wide range of disabilities can communicate, learn, travel and more. </p>
                <p>Featuring companies and people from 15 countries, the list was compiled through
                    more than 400 conversations with industry insiders over nine months, and with
                    the guidance of an expert advisory board. For the purposes of this list,
                    “Accessibility” is defined as software, devices and services that allow people
                    with disabilities to have equitable access to information, content, public
                    spaces and experiences. Disabilities considered include physical, sensory and
                    neurodivergent; types of accessibility include digital (technology, websites,
                    etc.), physical (access to public transportation and buildings) and
                    experientials (sports, careers and the like). </p>
                <p>Listmakers honored on the first ever Accessibility 100 list include:</p>

                <p>Senate Republicans on Monday proposed steeper Medicaid cuts than those included
                    in the House-passed version of President Donald Trump’s signature policy
                    bill—making the bill’s passage by the July 4 deadline set by Congressional
                    Republicans even more uncertain as Medicaid cuts have been a major sticking
                    point for some in the GOP.</p>

                            cuts of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years that could leave

                    Background</h2>
                <p>Congress approved topline spending goals earlier this year to enact Trump’s
                    agenda, instructing relevant committees in the House and Senate to write policy
                    legislation in line with the new figures. The bill approved by the House is the
                    result of that work. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid,
                    was tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts, and there was virtually no other
                    way to enact them without making changes to Medicaid. Medicaid emerged as a
                    major sticking point for Republicans negotiating the terms of the bill, with
                    those who represent swing districts initially advocating for Medicaid to be left
                    intact and fiscal hawks pushing for even more cuts. It was changed at the final
                    hour to move up the start date for work requirements from 2029 to 2026 to
                    appease hard-liners who threatened to withhold their votes and imperil the
                    bill’s passage. It was also revised to prohibit gender-affirming care for
                    adults, in addition to minors, as the initial version proposed, among other
                    revisions. The Medicaid cuts will help pay for increased spending on the border,
                    an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax breaks, and new provisions to eliminate taxes
                    on tips and overtime, among other measures.</p>

                    spending, but ultimately voted for the bill. Malliotakis was among eight who are
                    members of the Hispanic Conference or represent districts with sizeable Hispanic
                    populations and sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last month
                    warning “slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in
                    rural and predominantly Hispanic communities.” Malliotakis told <a

                    The Best Way To See The Northern Lights?</h2>
                <p>NOAA recommends traveling to a high vantage point away from light pollution to
                    see the northern lights, which the agency said are best seen between 10 p.m. and
                    2 a.m. local time.</p>
                <h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What’s
                    The Best Way To Photograph The Northern Lights?</h2>
                <p>With a smartphone, NOAA suggests enabling night mode and disabling flash, while
                    also using a tripod to stabilize the image. If using a regular camera,
                    photography experts told National Geographic it’s best to use a wide-angle lens,
                    an aperture or F-stop of four or less and a focus set to the furthest possible
                    setting.</p>
                <h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Key
                    Background</h2>
                <p>Activity on the sun’s surface achieved a “solar maximum” in October 2024, meaning
                    the northern lights could be more visible into early 2026. NOAA and NASA said
                    this peak corresponds with an increase in solar events like solar flares and
                    coronal mass ejections, which are responsible for the northern lights. Electrons
                    from these events collide with oxygen and nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere,
                    causing them to release energy in the form of swirling lights. The strongest
                    geomagnetic storm to reach Earth in two decades reached the atmosphere in May
                    2024, bringing the northern lights as far south as Florida and Texas.</p>

                    Russia. </strong>At a joint press conference with Austrian President Alexander
                    Van der Bellen, Zelenskyy urged Austria to support European Union sanctions
                    against Moscow and asked for a more forceful crackdown on Ukrainian corruption
                    suspects sheltering in Vienna. Zelenskyy thanked Austria, whose neutrality is
                    enshrined in its constitution and whose government is divided on supporting
                    Ukraine, for the $350 million in humanitarian and economic aid it has provided.</p>

                    have been a targeted attack on the American aerospace behemoth. </strong>The
                    strike came during an overnight bombardment involving over 300 drones. Verified
                    images showed structural damage in the facility. The company, however, stated
                    there had been “no operational disruption” after the strike. </p>
                <p> Although no employees were injured, the incident raised concerns over Moscow’s
                    deliberate targeting of Western companies with ties to Ukraine’s defense and
                    aviation sectors. Boeing collaborates with Ukrainian national aircraft
                    manufacturer Antonov despite war risks. According to the American Chamber of
                    Commerce in Ukraine, nearly one-third of its 700 member companies have suffered
                    employee casualties, and almost half have reported damage to facilities since

                    decline since a steady rise that began in December 2024. A new poll by the Kyiv
                    International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) shows the share of Ukrainians
                    expressing distrust in Zelenskyy has risen from 22% to 30%, an indication that
                    the “rally-around-the-flag” effect of U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election
                    and critical view of Ukraine is starting to subside.</p>
                <p> While Zelenskyy retains strong support in western regions with 73% approval,
                    confidence in him has fallen most sharply in central and southern Ukraine.
                    Analysts at KIIS note that as the wartime unity effects wane, Ukrainians are
                    increasingly attuned to internal issues, including corruption and quality of
                    governance, which may further erode Zelenskyy’s standing.</p>

                        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ruben Gnanalingam</a> and his
                    family—soared to a record high on Tuesday after the Malaysian government
                    approved increased cargo handling fees at Port Klang, the country’s key
                    transhipment hub.</p>
                <p>The higher tariffs will be implemented in three phases, with a 15% increase on
                    key container cargoes taking effect on July 15, Westports said in a statement on
                    Monday. The tariffs will rise by another 10% in January 2026 and by a further 5%
                    the following year, it added.</p>
                <p>“The tariff revision will facilitate ongoing investments to upgrade and support
                    the continued future growth of Port Klang as the largest gateway port in
                    Malaysia,” Westports said. Located about 40 kilometers west of Kuala Lumpur, the
                    terminal handled a record container volume of almost 11 million twenty-foot
                    equivalent units (TEUs) in 2024.</p>
                <p>Westports jumped 5.8% to 5.32 ringgit ($1.25) in late morning trading in Kuala
                    Lumpur, heading for its highest ever close. Maybank has turned positive on the
                    stock after the tariff hike, upgrading its rating to buy from hold.</p>
                <p>“The earlier-than-expected tariff implementation and a sharp increase in storage
                    charges could help offset margin pressures from potential congestion due to
                    operational inefficiencies,” Lon Yan Jin, an analyst at Maybank in Kuala Lumpur,
                    wrote in a note. “We also believe improved margins could cushion against any
                    volume slowdown should global trade weaken amid persistent or escalating
                    geopolitical tensions.” The brokerage estimates Westports’ net profit will rise
                    about 10% to 980 million ringgit this year and reach 1.2 billion next year.</p>
                <p>With a concession that runs until 2082, Westports is spending about $8 billion to
                    nearly double the port’s annual capacity to 27 million TEUs over the coming
                    decades. The company was cofounded by G. Gnanalingam and Ahmayuddin bin Ahmad on
                    securing the first concession in 1994. </p>
                <p>Gnanalingam—who started his career as a sales representative of British American
                    Tobacco group in 1968, before becoming marketing director in 1980—died two years
                    ago at age 78. His son Ruben helms Westports as executive chairman and group
                    managing director.</p>
                <p>With a net worth of $2.1 billion, the Gnanalingam family is among the wealthiest
                    in Malaysia. The family also holds stakes in football clubs Queensland Park
                    Rangers and LAFC.</p>

                <p>President Trump’s fortune rose from building glitzy towers brandishing his name.
                    His political star ascended by railing against illegal immigration. But
                    construction, his original cash cow, leans on those immigrants’ labor, whether

                <p>Immigrants make up 34% of the construction workforce, according to the Associated
                    General Contractors of America. In states like California, Texas, New Jersey,
                    Florida, Georgia and New York, they account for about half. Construction drives <a

                <p>That reliance on foreign born workers is now a growing risk. The trades were
                    already short on workers, with too few young people entering the field to meet
                    demand. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are making the gap
                    worse. Builders across the country are bracing for deeper shortages, higher
                    costs and delayed projects. The pain will not be spread evenly. Big firms with
                    market clout will find ways to adapt. Small builders and contractors may not.</p>
                <p>The roots of the construction labor shortage run deep. </p>
                <p>“We lost about a million and a half workers during the Great Recession,” says
                    Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders
                    (NAHB), a trade group that represents builders of single-family and multi-family
                    housing. Many of those workers left the industry and never came back. Since
                    then, fewer young people have entered the trades, with more choosing college
                    instead. Competition from other industries, including a fracking boom in the
                    mid-2010s, pulled more workers away. Meanwhile, productivity growth in
                    construction has lagged far behind the rest of the economy, leaving builders
                    trying to do more with fewer hands. What we’ve ended up with is “a persistent
                    shortage of workers,” Dietz says, and longer build times that are, according to
                    a recent Home Builders Institute <a

                        title="https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/06/new-study-reveals-significant-economic-impact-of-housing-industry-labor-shortage">
                    study</a>, already adding $10.8 billion in costs to the market each year while
                    reducing single family home construction by 19,000 units in 2024 alone.</p>
                <p>Yet, even as the industry struggles to attract enough workers, construction
                    offers wages that outpace many comparable fields.</p>
                <p>“Construction is not low paying compared to other jobs that require the same
                    education or training level,” says Ken Simonson, chief economist at the
                    Associated General Contractors of America. On average, construction workers earn
                    about 19% more than other production and non-supervisory workers, Simonson says,
                    a gap that has widened in recent years as firms compete for scarce labor.</p>
                <p>High wages, however, do little to ease the disruption caused by worksite ICE
                    raids.</p>
                <p>Small builders are already feeling the strain. David Knott and Saul Alvarez,
                    co-owners of <a href="https://www.sfrbuilders.com/"
                        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link"
                        title="https://www.sfrbuilders.com/">San Francisco Remodel</a>, said the
                    crackdown has shaken their workforce. Three workers they had hired in the past
                    were recently deported. The fear has spread across their job sites. Some workers
                    now avoid certain tasks or stay home. Knott and Alvarez say they do their best
                    to check paperwork and keep everything above board. But even workers in good
                    standing during the Biden administration are getting swept up. The result is
                    fewer available workers, higher prices and growing delays.</p>
                <p>“Mexico is the backbone of construction throughout the U.S.,” Knott says. “It’s
                    impossible to do what we used to do, there’s a scarcity in terms of finding
                    guys.”</p>
                <p>One reason the industry leans so hard on undocumented labor is that there are few
                    legal pathways to bring in foreign workers. But unlike agriculture, which has a
                    well-established visa system for seasonal labor, construction lacks a comparable
                    program. That gap has left the industry exposed. When enforcement ramps up,
                    there are few options for replacing the workers who disappear.</p>
                <p>This is why the National Association of Home Builders is pushing for immigration <a

                    reform</a>. The group wants a new visa program for construction workers, with
                    limits set by market demand, not fixed caps. It also supports pathways to legal
                    status for workers already on the job and opposes rules that would make builders
                    liable for the immigration status of their subcontractors’ employees. The goal
                    is to secure the border without gutting the workforce needed to build the
                    country’s housing.</p>
                <p>But until then, homeowners and builders alike will be left competing for fewer
                    workers. </p>
                <p>Some of the trades most likely to show up on your job site rely heavily on
                    immigrant labor. According to the Associated General Contractors of America, 61%

                    trades. Just 16% of electricians and 18% of plumbers are immigrants, in part
                    because these jobs require licenses. But for much of the work that gives a house
                    its character, the labor pool could shrink fast.</p>
                <p>The big public single-family homebuilders aren’t immune. </p>
                <p>In response to heightened rhetoric about mass deportations during the 2024
                    presidential election, three of the largest public homebuilders warned investors
                    about the risk. <strong>PulteGroup</strong> ($20.9 billion market
                    capitalization), <strong>Lennar Corporation</strong> ($29.5 billion) and <strong>Toll
                    Brothers</strong> ($10.9 billion) all added language about immigration
                    enforcement to their most recent annual reports (none of the three responded to
                    requests for comment). Each relies heavily on subcontractors for labor. All
                    three said tighter immigration enforcement could shrink the pool of skilled
                    tradespeople, push up labor costs and slow projects. PulteGroup identified it as
                    a “material risk.” Lennar flagged the potential for “widespread deportations”
                    and legal exposure tied to subcontractors. Toll Brothers warned that labor
                    shortages could affect the skilled workers it needs for high-end homes. These
                    warnings are new. None of the companies had included them in prior filings.</p>
                <p>However, some analysts covering the industry don’t see an imminent problem. </p>
                <p>“Builders don’t actually build the homes. They use subcontractors,” says Jay
                    McCanless, senior vice president of equity research at Wedbush, covering
                    homebuilders and building products. Builders expect subs to follow state rules
                    on verifying workers, but can’t guarantee it happens every time. Crews have been
                    raided at sites in California, Florida and elsewhere. Even so, McCanless says
                    today’s enforcement is nowhere near the scale seen under the Obama
                    administration in 2009 and 2010. </p>
                <p>Builders weathered that storm, helped by the collapse in housing demand after the
                    Great Financial Crisis. This time, they may catch another break. The slowdown in
                    multi-family construction is freeing up more crews. The risk may grow, and
                    already the stocks of home builders have suffered. Year-to-date, Lennar’s stock
                    is off 17%, Toll Brother’s is down 14% and Pulte is down 6%. The S&amp;P 500 has
                    gained 3.3% year to date. </p>
                <p>They may get another break yet. </p>

                    four or less and a focus set to the furthest possible setting is recommended.

                    Background</h2>
                <p>Activity on the sun’s surface peaked in October 2024, meaning the northern lights
                    will likely be more visible into early 2026, NOAA and NASA projections suggest.
                    This peak features an increase in solar events like solar flares and coronal
                    mass ejections, which are responsible for auroral activity. Molecules of oxygen
                    and nitrogen collide with electrons from these events, causing the electrons to
                    become “excited” before releasing energy in the form of light. </p>

                    Are The Six Criminal Charges Vance Boelter Faces</h2>
                <p>According to a copy of the June 15 federal criminal complaint, Boelter faces six
                    charges—including two counts of second-degree murder for killing Hortman and her
                    husband, which could mean a death penalty sentence; two counts of stalking
                    Hortman and Hoffman; and two counts of shooting both lawmakers and their
                    spouses. The complaint alleges Boelter “embarked on a planned campaign of
                    stalking and violence, designed to inflict fear, injure, and kill members of the
                    Minnesota state legislature and their families.” </p>

                    media accounts played up that Walz had appointed Boelter to a state bipartisan

                <p>President Donald Trump said Russia should be a part of the Group of 7 alliance
                    while meeting with fellow world leaders in Canada Monday, repeating calls he’s
                    made for Russia to be readmitted and fueling a disagreement with other world
                    leaders who have rejected Moscow’s inclusion. </p>

                            over its annexation of Crimea, a decision all seven other leaders made

                        <p>Trump’s desire to include Russia, and his overall embrace of President
                            Vladimir Putin, is among several issues that have fueled tensions

                <p>Trump also said Iran would “like to talk” when asked by a reporter whether he
                    knows if Iran would like to de-escalate its conflict with Israel. “They have to
                    make a deal. It’s painful for both parties . . . Iran is not winning this war,”
                    Trump said.</p>

                    Background</h2>
                <p>Leaders from the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
                    European Union met in Canada for the summit amid the 90-day pause on Trump’s
                    “reciprocal tariffs,” a moratorium that expires July 9. The meeting, hosted by
                    Canada, also comes as tensions between the U.S. and its northern neighbor remain
                    high as Canada has repeatedly rebuffed Trump’s suggestions that it should become
                    the 51st state. Carney and Trump met privately for about 45 minutes before the
                    official start of the summit and reportedly discussed trade. </p>

                        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">South Beach</a>—a mixed use property
                    housing the JW Marriott Hotel and an office tower—in a deal valuing the complex
                    at S$2.75 billion ($2.1 billion) by acquiring the 50.1% stake of City
                    Developments, which is controlled by billionaire Kwek Leng Beng and his family.</p>
                <p>“With its stable cash flows and prime location, South Beach is well-positioned to
                    anchor IOI Properties’ planned asset monetization exercise via a Singapore REIT
                    listing,” Tan Kai Shuen, an analyst at Hong Leong Investment Bank in Kuala
                    Lumpur, wrote in a recent research note. </p>
                <p>The Singapore REIT—comprising the South Beach complex and the newly completed IOI
                    Central Boulevard Towers in Marina Bay—could be listed by 2027 with assets worth
                    as much as S$8 billion, Tan wrote. IOI Properties is also developing yet another
                    Singapore landmark, a W Residences Marina View, comprising a hotel and a
                    residential condominium.</p>
                <p>Tan said IOI Properties could separately list a Malaysian REIT with assets worth
                    as much as 8 billion ringgit ($2.4 billion) as soon as next year. The group’s
                    assets in Malaysia include the IOI City commercial complex in Putrajaya, outside
                    Kuala Lumpur. The flagship property comprises a shopping mall (the biggest in
                    the country with a gross floor area of about 2.5 million square feet), office
                    towers and hotels.</p>
                <p>The company did not confirm nor deny the listing plans for the two REITs when
                    asked to comment on Hong Leong Investment Bank’s report.</p>
                <p>“IOI Properties Group will strategically consider and review various
                    possibilities in regards to monetizing our assets as we look to ensure the
                    group’s sustained growth ahead, both in Malaysia and Singapore,” the company
                    said in an emailed statement. “We are keeping our options open for any
                    opportunities by leveraging and optimising our position in creating additional
                    value for our stakeholders and strengthening our diverse offerings.”</p>
                <p>With a combined net worth of $5.2 billion, the Lee brothers are among the
                    wealthiest in Malaysia. They are the sons of the late Lee Shin Cheng, who built
                    a thriving palm oil and property business until his death in 2019. Lee Yeow Chor
                    runs the palm oil business under separately listed IOI Corp, while his younger
                    brother Yeow Seng helms the real estate company.</p>

            <description>After a decade-long fight with the SEC, Brazil-based JBS is now publicly
                listed in America, despite the history of corruption by its billionaire board
                directors Joesley and Wesley Batista.</description>

            <content:encoded>
                <p>In the first hours since the world’s largest meatpacker began trading on the New
                    York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker JBS, the stock had a slow start
                    before ending the day up nearly 5%. </p>
                <p>The addition of American investors has been expected to help the Brazilian
                    conglomerate with $77 billion in 2024 revenue from processing and selling beef,
                    pork, chicken and lamb to more than 100 countries. During the first day of
                    trading, shares rose around 3% before briefly falling past where the stock
                    opened at $13.65 per share at around 2:30 p.m eastern.<strong> </strong>As of
                    the close of markets, the stock was back up and hit a high $14.29, or around 5%
                    up. The market capitalization of JBS was more than<strong> </strong>$31 billion.
                    And the billionaire sons of the founder, who guided the expansion of JBS beyond
                    Brazil—and went to jail seven years ago after its American acquisition spree got
                    ensnared in a massive corruption scandal involving 1,800 politicians in their
                    homeland—are now richer for it. </p>
                <p>As JBS stock rose, the net worths of Joesley and Wesley Batista increased an
                    estimated $200 million each. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the
                    company and serve as board directors, are now worth $4.8 billion each. Together,
                    through family holding companies, they own nearly 50% of JBS. </p>

                            York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, were personally charged with
                    foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil
                    (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them
                    briefly jailed in Brazil for about six months from 2017 to 2018. </p>
                <p>In all, the Batistas and one of their holding companies agreed to more than three
                    dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation
                    agreements with the Brazilian government. And the U.S. Department of Justice and
                    Securities and Exchange Commission found evidence of some $150 million in
                    kickback when the Batistas and their holding company, J&amp;F Investimentos,
                    pled guilty to U.S. foreign corruption charges in 2020. J&amp;F paid a $128
                    million criminal fine as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice.
                    J&amp;F also paid $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC. At
                    the same time, the Batista brothers, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil
                    penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each.</p>
                <p>Until 2025, there had been a bipartisan effort to stop the U.S. listing on the
                    NYSE. Last year, 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and
                    John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie
                    Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—<a

                        title="https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JBS%20SEC%20Letter.pdf">denounced
                    a potential IPO</a>. Years prior, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now
                    Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics and twice requested a broad
                    investigation by the Treasury Department into the Batistas and their assets. </p>
                <p>The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after the
                    Trump Administration’s new SEC chairman was sworn into office. </p>
                <p>The SEC approval also came two days after it was revealed in a public filing with
                    the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural
                    Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5
                    million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks
                    given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A
                    JBS spokesperson has denied any link in the timing of the donation. The Trump
                    Administration did not return request for comment. </p>
                <p>Allowing JBS to trade in the U.S. is likely bad news for America’s homegrown—and
                    largest overall—meatpacker, Tyson. With a market capitalization of just under
                    $20 billion, Tyson is slightly bigger than JBS in beef and chicken, but its
                    stock price has been struggling, down 8%, in the past three months. </p>
                <p>Tyson has historically traded at around double the multiple of JBS, but analysts
                    expect the addition of JBS to an American stock exchange to change that, which
                    means JBS will have more buying power, and the competition is on. </p>
                <p>“Food is a national security issue,” says Carlos Laboy, the lead analyst on JBS
                    at HSBC. “It benefits the United States to have the largest protein company in
                    the world not only operated in the U.S. but listed in the U.S. and with the
                    oversight of U.S. regulators. The alternative scenarios are not favorable to the
                    U.S.”</p>

                <p>Upon completion of the deal in the third quarter of this year, IOI Properties
                    will fully own the commercial property, comprising the JW Marriott Hotel in a
                    45-story skyscraper, a 34-story office tower and retail space. The 190-unit
                    South Beach Residences has been fully sold since September 2021. </p>
                <p>“The acquisition of the 100% equity stake in this landmark development marks a
                    significant strategic expansion for IOI Properties,” Lee Yeow Seng, group CEO of
                    IOI Properties, said in the statement.</p>

                    It recently opened the IOI Central Boulevard Towers in Marina Bay. Built at a
                    cost of about S$4 billion (including the land cost), the complex comprises a
                    seven-story podium, a 16-story tower and a 48-story skyscraper. Nearby, the
                    company is developing yet another landmark, a W Residences Marina View,
                    comprising a hotel and a residential condominium.</p>
                <p>With a combined net worth of $5.2 billion, the Lee brothers are among the
                    wealthiest in Malaysia. They are the sons of the late Lee Shin Cheng, who built
                    a thriving palm oil and property business until his death in 2019. Lee Yeow Chor
                    runs the palm oil business under separately listed IOI Corp, while his younger
                    brother Yeow Seng helms the real estate company.</p>
                <p>For City Developments, the divestment of its stake in South Beach would help the
                    company pare down its debts, which has eroded its bottomline. CDL’s net profit
                    slumped 37% to S$201 million in 2024 amid weaker contributions from property
                    development and increased finance charges.</p>
                <p>Sherman Kwek, group CEO of CDL, said proceeds from the divestment will help
                    reduce the company’s gearing and redeploy capital. The company has been
                    selectively developing new residential projects in Singapore amid softening
                    demand.</p>
                <p>City Developments this week submitted the highest bid of S$608 million for a
                    residential plot in the western Singapore suburb of Jurong. It plans to build
                    five 16-story residential blocks with a total of 575 units on the site, which
                    sits right next to the Lakeside MRT station.</p>
                <p>“We look forward to creating a vibrant residential community that complements the
                    ongoing transformation of the Jurong Lake District into a vibrant lifestyle and
                    commercial hub, aligned with Singapore’s broader decentralisation strategy and
                    future growth corridors,” Sherman Kwek said in a separate statement.</p>
