That’s how much the bill would add to the federal debt over the next decade, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released Wednesday that estimates it would cost $4.2 trillion, mostly from tax cuts, and save $1.8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot,” Trump said while sitting next to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk—who left his White House role last week—has fired off dozens of tweets this week attacking Trump’s policy bill over the amount it’s expected to add to the federal debt. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk wrote Tuesday on X in his initial post bashing the legislation, calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled . . . disgusting abomination.” Musk attacked Trump directly over the bill for the first time since he began his days-long rant moments before Trump sat down with Merz by reposting the president’s 2013 tweet about the debt ceiling. In other tweets last week targeting the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Musk threatened Republicans who voted for it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929984535456035202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929984535456035202&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people” and calling for lawmakers to “KILL The BILL.” Until Trump’s comments last Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.—who shepherded the bill through the House—was the top Republican defending the legislation against Musk’s criticism. Johnson said Wednesday Trump is “not delighted that Elon did a 180.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;What To Watch For&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, passed by the House in a party-line vote last month after last-minute revisions to appease Republican holdouts, is being negotiated by the Senate. Republican leaders have set a July 4 deadline to put the bill on Trump’s desk for signage, but GOP resistance in the upper chamber—and some expressions of regret from a few House Republicans who said they were unaware of certain provisions—threaten to delay its passage. The legislation would fulfill Trump’s key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, no taxes on tips and overtime and additional border security, paid for, in part, by cuts to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tesla And Trump Stock Battered, Crypto Prices Drop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares dropped 14% last Thursday as Musk clashed with Trump, closing at $284.70 and completely erasing a month’s worth of gains it made in May. The fall marked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/06/05/tesla-plummets-14-in-stocks-11th-worst-day-ever-as-musks-feud-with-trump-escalates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/06/05/tesla-plummets-14-in-stocks-11th-worst-day-ever-as-musks-feud-with-trump-escalates/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;11th-worst single trading day&lt;/a&gt; for the electric vehicle maker since it went public in 2010, according to FactSet. Musk, who owns about 12% of Tesla excluding options, saw his estimated net worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/06/05/elon-musk-becomes-27-billion-poorer-as-trump-quarrel-eats-into-net-worth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/06/05/elon-musk-becomes-27-billion-poorer-as-trump-quarrel-eats-into-net-worth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tumble by $27 billion&lt;/a&gt; to $388 billion (he still remains the world’s wealthiest person by far). Tesla’s stock fully rebounded over the next few trading sessions, reaching the $330 mark as Musk’s net worth rose to $413 billion. Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group’s stock closed down 8% at $20.12 the day of Trump and Musk’s clash, though its share price did not recover to the same extent Tesla’s did. Multiple cryptocurrencies also slumped amid the spat, with ethereum falling 7%, Solana dropping 6% and the Musk-backed dogecoin sliding 9% last Thursday. Bitcoin prices did not fall as sharply as its competitors’ prices, but still sunk by 3% on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tangent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Musk and Trump were palpable during the joint press conference they held May 30 to mark Musk’s last day leading the Department of Government Efficiency. While the two praised each other, their once-lighthearted rapport appeared stiff and uneasy. Musk in particular appeared to be in an odd mood, prompting social media users to claim he was “tweaking out,” suggesting he may have been under the influence of drugs, as the press conference was held hours after a New York Times report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/30/musk-used-heavy-drugs-including-ketamine-and-ecstasy-while-he-became-close-to-trump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/30/musk-used-heavy-drugs-including-ketamine-and-ecstasy-while-he-became-close-to-trump/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;alleging&lt;/a&gt; Musk engaged in heavy drug use while he campaigned for Trump last year. Musk also sported a black eye during the press conference, which the Tesla CEO claimed he got from his five-year-old son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/04/kill-the-bill-musk-deepens-rant-against-trumps-signature-policy-legislation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/04/kill-the-bill-musk-deepens-rant-against-trumps-signature-policy-legislation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;‘KILL The BILL’: Musk Deepens Rant Against Trump’s Signature Policy Legislation &lt;/a&gt;(Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/12/05/musk-calls-for-ending-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-which-could-help-tesla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/12/05/musk-calls-for-ending-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-which-could-help-tesla/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Musk Calls For Ending Electric Vehicle Tax Credit—Which Could Help Tesla &lt;/a&gt;(Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/30/musk-used-heavy-drugs-including-ketamine-and-ecstasy-while-he-became-close-to-trump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/30/musk-used-heavy-drugs-including-ketamine-and-ecstasy-while-he-became-close-to-trump/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Musk Cuts Off Reporter Asking About Drug Use Allegations—Including Ketamine, Ecstasy And Adderall&lt;/a&gt; (Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; last year, which said Trump’s immunity from some criminal charges includes charges that are based on evidence from his official presidential acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts-element&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has so far stayed in state court because judges have ruled the case only concerns Trump’s actions as a private citizen, rather than as president: New York Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial, has thrown out Trump’s request to move or throw out the charges, as did U.S. District Judge Alan Hellerstein, who ruled the payments at issue in the case “were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;What Did The Appeals Court Say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel expressed some skepticism Wednesday of Trump’s efforts to have the case moved after he had already been sentenced, noting that moving a criminal case from state to federal court at such a late stage would be unprecedented. The judges didn’t rule out the possibility that doing so would be allowed, however, pushing back on prosecutors’ suggestion that it’s impossible to move the case at such a late stage and saying there are “competing interpretations” of the law on that issue. Judges also questioned prosecutors’ claims that the evidence concerning Trump’s time as president shouldn’t be enough to justify moving the case—because the evidence was relatively minor—noting the Supreme Court’s language on evidence being included under presidential immunity was “very broad” and thus could even include such minor testimony. While judges noted the unprecedented nature of criminal charges against a former president means the “boundaries [of the case] are not clear,” they suggested they could be leaning toward allowing the case to be removed to federal court, asking both parties in the case about what the logistics would look like if they did order removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;What Dispute Means For Trump’s Legal Cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hush money case is the only criminal case against Trump that actually went to trial, as the president has been overwhelmingly able to get out of the criminal charges against him. The two federal cases brought against the now-president were dropped in the wake of his election, and while Trump’s other set of state criminal charges in Georgia remain pending, that case is a long shot to move forward. A state court ruled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who led the prosecution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/12/19/fani-willis-disqualified-in-trump-georgia-case-heres-what-happens-next/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/12/19/fani-willis-disqualified-in-trump-georgia-case-heres-what-happens-next/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;should be disqualified&lt;/a&gt; over her romantic relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade. The Georgia Supreme Court still has to weigh in on the dispute, but if it agrees Willis should be kicked off the case, it remains to be seen when Trump could go to trial—and if he ever will. That means if the appeals court does rule Trump’s hush money case should move to federal court and the case is subsequently dismissed, it could erase the only criminal conviction against Trump and the president’s status as a “convicted felon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;What To Watch For&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how long it will take the appeals court to rule on the case. If the court agrees with lower court judges and declines to move the case to federal court, Trump could take the dispute to the Supreme Court and ask justices there to rule on his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Surprising Fact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump will be backed at the federal appeals court by the Department of Justice—which includes the defense attorneys that previously represented him in a personal capacity at his criminal trial.

Trump was convicted based on his checks to Cohen reimbursing the lawyer for his payment to Daniels, as prosecutors successfully alleged the checks were falsely labeled as being for legal services. The president has strongly denied the charges and conviction against him and pleaded not guilty, decrying the case as a politically motivated “witch hunt” against him. After the sentencing got postponed for months in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling giving Trump some immunity from legal charges, followed by Trump’s election, Merchan formally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/10/trump-not-sentenced-to-any-punishments-in-hush-money-criminal-case/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/10/trump-not-sentenced-to-any-punishments-in-hush-money-criminal-case/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;sentenced Trump&lt;/a&gt; for his crimes in January. Trump was sentenced to an “unconditional discharge,” meaning the conviction will stand and Trump can be formally called a “convicted felon,” but he faces no punishments for his crimes. The judge said at the sentencing that the decision was solely because of Trump’s election as president, saying an unconditional discharge is the only “lawful sentence” that would not “[encroach] upon the highest office in the land.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/10/trump-not-sentenced-to-any-punishments-in-hush-money-criminal-case/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump Formally Convicted—But Faces No Punishment&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump Formally Convicted—But Faces No Punishment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/67812a06a866a7620dd2bf1a/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=1625&amp;amp;cropY1=70&amp;amp;cropY2=985&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/05/30/trump-convicted-of-felony-in-hush-money-trial-heres-what-happens-next-live-updates/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump Convicted Of All 34 Felonies In Hush Money Trial: Here’s What Happens Next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump Convicted Of All 34 Felonies In Hush Money Trial: Here’s What Happens Next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6657732966c4ac828ac77798/960x0.jpg?cropX1=168&amp;amp;cropX2=1869&amp;amp;cropY1=0&amp;amp;cropY2=956&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/07/01/trump-wins-partial-victory-supreme-court-says-he-has-some-presidential-immunity-from-charges/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump Wins Partial Victory: Supreme Court Says He Has Some Presidential Immunity From Charges&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump Wins Partial Victory: Supreme Court Says He Has Some Presidential Immunity From Charges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/665ee8579221aa7feacdc250/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=2436&amp;amp;cropY1=50&amp;amp;cropY2=1419&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

Kennedy Jr. purged the group that advises the CDC on vaccines in order to replace its members with those of his own choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, is composed of 17 vaccination experts and is generally not political. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj20soCXgFy2TAZs30LSRikigT96-PCe6kRyonji8tQtvq3wJF6YnwH_TEgy00%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=684843a5&amp;amp;gaa_sig=SNsSVZJI4zJLSRctYkdG-E7d7a48s1_tTXcBfJ3AJGEhH1RIpvo8CKAejFF77-4RU2DtXy0wbjfe6trMDSI89A%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj20soCXgFy2TAZs30LSRikigT96-PCe6kRyonji8tQtvq3wJF6YnwH_TEgy00%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=684843a5&amp;amp;gaa_sig=SNsSVZJI4zJLSRctYkdG-E7d7a48s1_tTXcBfJ3AJGEhH1RIpvo8CKAejFF77-4RU2DtXy0wbjfe6trMDSI89A%3D%3D&quot;&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;editorial,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy claimed that “a clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by RFK Jr., who has long expressed antipathy toward vaccinations and promoted conspiracy theories, was roundly condemned by public health experts. It typically takes a year to vet individual members of the panel, but the new members appear to be scheduled to meet at the next scheduled ACIP meeting in Atlanta later this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Medical Association criticized the ousters in a statement, saying that it  “undermines trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.” The association noted that it would “fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses” at a time when the measles outbreak was ongoing and routine child vaccination rates have been declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the purge,  Kennedy had been chipping away at vaccines.

ACIP should be given awards, not fired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Billionaire Sanjit Biswas Is Funding Research On AI And Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6848ae08644ca357ad28fa9a/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Samsara cofounder and CEO Sanjit Biswas&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsara cofounder and CEO Sanjit Biswas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Samsara&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsara cofounder and CEO Sanjit Biswas&lt;/strong&gt; built his business by applying AI to an area where that was unusual for its time: industrial and physical operations. Now Biswas, who is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/sanjit-biswas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/sanjit-biswas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;worth $4.8 billion by &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;estimates,&lt;/a&gt; wants to apply similar technology to healthcare with his philanthropy. After taking $25 billion (market cap) Samsara public in December 2021, Biswas and his wife Hope Biswas, who has a Ph.D. in epidemiology, established the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biswasfamilyfoundation.org/science/funded-research&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.biswasfamilyfoundation.org/science/funded-research&quot;&gt;Biswas Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt; with $100 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group began making grants in 2023, and has been giving away funds in batches of $15 million a year since. The grants are typically $3 million to $4 million each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have always thought about technology as a way to have a tremendous amount of impact on the world,” Biswas tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. With the foundation, he hopes to find the sweet spot between startups, which already have access to VC funding, and pure scientific research that’s years or even decades away from commercialization—work  that, as Biswas puts it, has “translational impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area that Biswas has funded: using AI to find new uses for existing drugs. One effort he’s funded, led by Marinka Zitnik, a biomedical informatics researcher at Harvard Medical School, is building a comprehensive benchmark for &lt;a href=&quot;https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/news/txgnn-ai-dr-house-for-disease-treatment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/news/txgnn-ai-dr-house-for-disease-treatment/&quot;&gt;computational drug repurposing&lt;/a&gt;. While physicians have long prescribed drugs off-label, “it’s not done in a systematic way,” Biswas says. With this project, he hopes researchers will be able to find new uses for existing drugs at scale, including for rare diseases, with the help of tools like deidentified medical records..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Biswas-funded project, led by Stanford University’s Anshul Kundaje, aims to develop an AI chatbot with access to genomic knowledge to improve diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. And a third effort, led by Katherine Pollard, director of data science and biotechnology at the Gladstone Institutes, is developing personalized diagnosis and treatment for colorectal and skin cancers using machine learning models, which can fit the right treatment to the specific genetic mutation of a patient’s tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to longstanding researchers like these, Biswas’s foundation last December began &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/launch-mit-heals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/launch-mit-heals&quot;&gt;funding a group of MIT post-doctoral researchers&lt;/a&gt; in areas that include AI and health and low-cost diagnostics. These early-career scientists are more likely to stay in the field if they can get funding at that stage, Biswas says—something that’s especially critical right now given the drastic cutbacks to NIH and NSF funding under Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Administration’s cutbacks have been so large that private efforts—even enormous ones like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/magazine/bill-gates-foundation-closing-2045.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/magazine/bill-gates-foundation-closing-2045.html&quot;&gt;Bill Gates’ recently announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to wind down his foundation and give away $200 billion in 20 years—can’t possibly fill the gap. While acknowledging the scale of that hole, Biswas (who says that “in another life I would go do a doctoral dissertation in this area for sure”) notes that he plans to increase his philanthropic commitment over time to fund research at the intersection of AI and medicine to better diagnose and treat disease. “We are leaning in more heavily,” he says. “The number will go up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOTECH AND PHARMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250609303937/en/U.S.-FDA-Approves-Mercks-ENFLONSIA-clesrovimab-cfor-for-Prevention-of-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Lower-Respiratory-Tract-Disease-in-Infants-Born-During-or-Entering-Their-First-RSV-Season&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250609303937/en/U.S.-FDA-Approves-Mercks-ENFLONSIA-clesrovimab-cfor-for-Prevention-of-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Lower-Respiratory-Tract-Disease-in-Infants-Born-During-or-Entering-Their-First-RSV-Season&quot;&gt;approved a new monoclonal antibody from Merck to protect against RSV. &lt;/a&gt;The new drug, clesrovimab, will be sold under the brand name Enflonsia. The drug protects infants  from RSV shortly before their first season of the disease, which is typically in the fall or winter. In clinical trials, the drug reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by 84%. Sanofi and AstraZeneca already market a similar drug, called Beyfortus, but Enflonsia is simpler because all babies get the same dose in an injection, while the proper dose for Beyfortus depends on the weight of the baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn't matter if the baby's small or if the baby's large–a single shot is sufficient,” Merck’s chief medical officer Eliav Barr told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. The next step for Enflonsia is to be evaluated by ACIP later this month, assuming the advisory group still meets as scheduled after its shakeup. Barr said that Merck plans to be ready to bring the drug to market in time for RSV season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGITAL HEALTH AND AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual care company Omada Health went public on Friday, following digital health company Hinge Health by a few weeks. The company raised some $150 million from the IPO. That new capital will help Omada (which now has a market cap of $1 billion) expand its business, CEO Sean Duffy said. It currently has more than 700,000 people under active care management for chronic diseases such as diabetes, 31% of whom actually use the company’s platform to care for multiple chronic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omada’s shares shot up Friday, closing at $23, a 21% gain over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/press-releases/omada-health-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/press-releases/omada-health-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering&quot;&gt;initial price of $19&lt;/a&gt;. But by Tuesday, investors had pushed the stock back down, to $18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOSPITALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Medical Colleges detailed the impact of the Trump Administration’s proposed budget cuts on hospital systems in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aamc.org/about-us/aamc-leads/impact-federal-actions-academic-medicine-and-us-health-care-system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.aamc.org/about-us/aamc-leads/impact-federal-actions-academic-medicine-and-us-health-care-system&quot;&gt;report released Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Changes to student loan programs will likely reduce the number of medical students, which will exacerbate the existing doctor shortage at hospitals, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposed changes to how outpatient care is reimbursed could cost hospitals $167 billion over the next 10 years, while proposed cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates will strain already fragile hospital finances.

It opened at 182 yuan, 285% above its IPO price of 47.27 yuan, reaching a peak of almost 188 yuan before closing at 177 yuan. This was the largest listing on the STAR Market this year, and proceeds will mainly be used to back future research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer science graduate from Nanjing University, Liu, who goes by his initials “JK,” founded Insta360 in 2015 and was featured on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-asia/2017/consumer-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-asia/2017/consumer-technology/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Based on Liu’s roughly 26.8% stake in the company, including a stake held by his wife, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; estimates his net worth to be $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ten years ago, we walked out of the dormitory of Nanjing University, with just very few resources and very big dreams,” Liu said in a speech at Insta360’s listing ceremony in Shanghai. “Ten years have passed, and our flagship devices have progressed from ONE X to X5…the further we go, the clearer our original vision has become.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684975887064d2918a597885/960x0.png?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Insta360 X5&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insta360's X5 camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Courtesy of Insta360&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a wide range of consumer imaging products, Insta360 has gained traction among videographers and content creators worldwide. Its products include its ‘X’ series of 360-degree action cameras, which are capable of taking high-resolution spherical videos, and ‘Go’ series of compact, lightweight action cameras. In 2024, the company reached 5.6 billion yuan ($779.9 million) in revenue, up 53.3% year-over-year, and 994.7 million yuan in profit, up 19.9% year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving Insta360’s rapid growth is its strong domestic sales and international expansion in key markets such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Last year, 76% of its revenue came from overseas sales, according to its prospectus, with 1.3 billion yuan in sales from the U.S. alone. The company says it has 2,000 employees worldwide in offices located in China, U.S., Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its debut, Insta360’s backers have included Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Chinese smartphone and EV maker Xiaomi and food delivery giant Meituan; IDG Capital Partners, whose partners on the Forbes Midas list have included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/young-guo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/young-guo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Young Guo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/meng-lian/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/meng-lian/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Meng Lian&lt;/a&gt;; Nasdaq-listed tech giant Xunlei; and leading Chinese retailer Suning Holdings Group. Dubbed a “little giant” by Chinese state media for its status as a rising tech enterprise, the camera maker raised $30 million in a 2019 funding round, which included participation from Chinese investment firms Everest Venture Capital, MG Holdings and Huajin Capital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684975f7095e866bc66e7fe4/960x0.png?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Insta360 Go 3&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insta360's GO 3S camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Courtesy of Insta360&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Insta360 may face considerable headwinds from threats of a U.S.-China trade war. The company noted in its prospectus that “uncertainty of the company's overseas business development has increased,” citing the White House’s evolving stance on tariffs since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company may also need to navigate competitors in the field of consumer electronics. Insta360 stated its competitors include Nasdaq-listed GoPro and billionaire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/frank-wang/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/frank-wang/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Frank Wang&lt;/a&gt;’s Shenzhen-headquartered DJI, which specializes in drones but also sells action cameras. In 2024, the U.S. International Trade Commission announced it would investigate a complaint filed by GoPro against Insta360 for alleged patent infringement, although results of this investigation have not been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other technological innovations in focus for the company include VR compatibility and AI editing features. Earlier this week, Apple named Insta360 as a partner for its Vision Pro headset, which will natively support videos shot with the camera brand’s flagship devices. In April, Insta360 unveiled a suite of new AI-powered tools for its eponymous app, which the company says can automatically add music and transitions to footage its users capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueling the demand for Insta360’s cameras is a new generation of content creators, who may seek out more sophisticated camera equipment to create engaging videos. As of 2023, there were an estimated 50 million creators online and five billion social media users worldwide, according to a report by Deloitte. In a burgeoning global “creator economy,” social commerce is expected to be worth $2 trillion by 2026, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2025/06/09/midas-list-2025-asias-top-venture-capitalists-ride-ai-wave-as-china-reclaims-tech-spotlight/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Midas List 2025: Asia’s Top Venture Capitalists Ride AI Wave As China Reclaims Tech Spotlight&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Midas List 2025: Asia’s Top Venture Capitalists Ride AI Wave As China Reclaims Tech Spotlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Zinnia Lee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6842b102a9c8a915c5262ab7/960x0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2025/04/01/the-10-richest-chinese-billionaires-2025/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;The 10 Richest Chinese Billionaires 2025&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 10 Richest Chinese Billionaires 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Yue Wang&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/67eb7f4cc20aa247d5bff822/0x0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2025/03/03/billionaire-brothers-chinese-bubble-tea-giant-mixue-surges-in-hong-kong-debut/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Billionaire Brothers’ Chinese Bubble Tea Giant Mixue Surges In Hong Kong Debut&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billionaire Brothers’ Chinese Bubble Tea Giant Mixue Surges In Hong Kong Debut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Zinnia Lee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/67c545e98961b7bb0103f62f/960x0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

It’s likely the dispute will then go to the Supreme Court, as either Trump or the plaintiffs in the case are expected to appeal the Federal Circuit’s ruling no matter how the court rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Chief Critic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwab said Tuesday the Liberty Justice Center—which represented small businesses impacted by the tariffs—is “disappointed the federal circuit allowed the unlawful tariffs to remain in place temporarily.” The group is “glad the federal circuit recognized the importance of this case, and agreed to hear it before the full court on an expedited schedule,” Schwab added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Why Could Trump’s Tariffs Be Unlawful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue in the court dispute is whether or not Trump actually had the authority to impose his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs, which impose fees on imports from nearly all countries. Trump imposed the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which grants presidents authority to levy some economic sanctions against other countries during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly say anything about tariffs, however, leading plaintiffs to claim Trump didn’t have the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA—and even if he did, the U.S.’s trade imbalances with other countries are not an “emergency” that justifies invoking the law. A three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade agreed with plaintiffs, striking down Trump’s tariffs in May because IEEPA does not give him the power to impose them. That ruling is now what’s before the Federal Circuit, though a different federal district judge has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/05/29/trumps-tariffs-get-struck-down-again-by-second-court/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/05/29/trumps-tariffs-get-struck-down-again-by-second-court/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;separately ruled&lt;/a&gt; Trump doesn’t have the power to impose tariffs under IEEPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, imposing tariffs on nearly all countries despite warnings from economists that doing so could raise prices for consumers and harm the economy. The “Liberation Day” tariffs have been broadly controversial, upending global markets and sparking fears of a recession, and the Trump administration rolled back the worst of the tariffs in response to the chaos, keeping a 10% baseline rate in place. Small businesses and Democratic leaders have challenged the tariffs in court as a result: the two lawsuits at issue before the Federal Circuit were brought by small businesses and Democratic-led states, while other businesses and the state of California have brought separate legal claims. The Trump administration has insisted on the tariffs’ legality despite the lawsuits and court rulings against them, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claiming Trump’s tariffs are “legally sound and grounded in common sense” and the panel of judges at the Court of International Trade—which included a Trump appointee”—“brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/05/29/trumps-tariffs-will-stay-in-effect-for-now-appeals-court-rules/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump’s Tariffs Will Stay In Effect—For Now—Appeals Court Rules&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s Tariffs Will Stay In Effect—For Now—Appeals Court Rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/67fe8442d4300daafb8c282a/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=4289&amp;amp;cropY1=64&amp;amp;cropY2=2475&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/05/29/trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-struck-down-in-court-stock-futures-surge/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ Tariffs Struck Down In Court—U.S. Stock Futures Surge&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ Tariffs Struck Down In Court—U.S. Stock Futures Surge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6838256b67dd5a8a5e3dfe91/960x0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/05/29/trumps-tariffs-get-struck-down-again-by-second-court/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Trump’s Tariffs Get Struck Down—Again—By Second Court&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;MORE FROM FORBES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s Tariffs Get Struck Down—Again—By Second Court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Alison Durkee&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/67fe8442d4300daafb8c282a/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=4289&amp;amp;cropY1=82&amp;amp;cropY2=2493&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

Glendale officials said the move was “a local decision and was not made lightly,” as the city “recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive.” Glendale’s city manager opted to end the contract after “careful evaluation of legal, operational and community considerations,” the city said, noting the decision was not “politically driven.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Does Trump Have The Authority To Deploy The California National Guard?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump reportedly said in a memo he is invoking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleE-partII-chap1211-sec12406.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleE-partII-chap1211-sec12406.htm&quot;&gt;Title 10&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, which allows the federal government to deploy the National Guard if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,” or if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” Vice President &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/jdvance/status/1931524890663821598?s=46&amp;amp;t=blEbYi04tIEX1M7_x-G1FQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://x.com/jdvance/status/1931524890663821598?s=46&amp;amp;t=blEbYi04tIEX1M7_x-G1FQ&quot;&gt;JD Vance&lt;/a&gt; said in a post on X on Saturday night the influx of immigrants, which he called “Biden’s border crisis,” amounts to an “invasion,” rebuffing critics who have questioned whether Trump had the authority to deploy troops. Trump’s move has faced some pushback from constitutional scholars. “For the federal government to take over the California National Guard, without the request of the governor, to put down protests is truly chilling,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law, told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-07/what-is-title-10-trump-homan-national-guard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-07/what-is-title-10-trump-homan-national-guard&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-07/what-is-title-10-trump-homan-national-guard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-07/what-is-title-10-trump-homan-national-guard&quot;&gt;The legal issues raised by Trump sending the National Guard to L.A.&lt;/a&gt; (Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

U.S. officials expressed concerns, however, that Beijing continued to impose export restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets despite the truce, prompting the U.S. to limit semiconductor exports from companies such as Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/05/trump-and-xi-jinping-hold-highly-anticipated-call-china-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/05/trump-and-xi-jinping-hold-highly-anticipated-call-china-says/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Trump Says Call With Xi Was Focused On Trade, ‘Very Positive’&lt;/a&gt; (Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/06/04/trumps-steel-tariff-hike-takes-effect-here-are-the-22-times-hes-changed-his-mind-on-tariffs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/06/04/trumps-steel-tariff-hike-takes-effect-here-are-the-22-times-hes-changed-his-mind-on-tariffs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Trump’s Steel Tariff Hike Takes Effect—Here Are The 22 Times He’s Changed His Mind On Tariffs&lt;/a&gt; (Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/05/30/trump-accuses-china-of-violating-us-trade-agreement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/05/30/trump-accuses-china-of-violating-us-trade-agreement/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Trump Accuses China Of Violating U.S. Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Airline fares, eggs, smartphones and jewelry all dropped at least 1.5% month-over-month. On the flip side, household staples including bananas, peanut butter, propane and major appliances all got at least 3% costlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s below forecast inflation print is reassuring – but only to an extent,” Seema Shah Principal Asset Management’s chief global strategist, wrote in emailed comments. “Tariff-driven price increases may not feed through to the CPI data for a few more months yet, so it is far too premature to assume that the price shock will not materialize,” explained Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Big Number&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.9%. That’s where core CPI inflation will settle by the end of 2025, according to UBS economists. A full percentage point higher than May’s reading, that would be the highest inflation since January 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core inflation did not register at 3.9% or higher from 1993 to 2020, putting in perspective the continuously high inflation pervading the U.S. economy since the COVID-19 pandemic. Though inflation has slowly cooled from the four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, economists warn Trump’s tariffs will likely result in a renewed uptick in prices for Americans. “Meaningfully larger increases are likely in coming months, although the precise timing and extent of the tariff effects on consumer prices is uncertain,” Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist at the country’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, explained in a recent note to clients. Yet Trump has repeatedly and falsely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-cpi-inflation-tariffs-05-13-2025/card/trump-post-with-no-inflation-federal-reserve-must-lower-interest-rates-CacHe0RpQ9WcDhoETe2T?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh9AwRzjFTY_Pn_7et1T084wuPfuxgpWkp6ryXCaT_VDo3zJ-n7_OnrNSVjp74%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=684848d2&amp;amp;gaa_sig=52V9O8z8weCyfYhAIBAAvzlK3yjcINxEiWyr01BL6gy-lUASvNIo0Kr8CuITNh4oFK22sxjVs7KFSKL1gnt_Og%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-cpi-inflation-tariffs-05-13-2025/card/trump-post-with-no-inflation-federal-reserve-must-lower-interest-rates-CacHe0RpQ9WcDhoETe2T?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh9AwRzjFTY_Pn_7et1T084wuPfuxgpWkp6ryXCaT_VDo3zJ-n7_OnrNSVjp74%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=684848d2&amp;amp;gaa_sig=52V9O8z8weCyfYhAIBAAvzlK3yjcINxEiWyr01BL6gy-lUASvNIo0Kr8CuITNh4oFK22sxjVs7KFSKL1gnt_Og%3D%3D&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; there is “no inflation” in his heavyhanded campaign for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The Fed cuts rates when inflation is on trend to stabilize at 2%, and though it began cutting rates last year, it has not lowered borrowing costs since December even as other central banks took that path, as the Fed largely hesitated in response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/16/trumps-tariffs-highly-likely-to-boost-inflation-says-fed-chair-powell/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/16/trumps-tariffs-highly-likely-to-boost-inflation-says-fed-chair-powell/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;unknown effects&lt;/a&gt; of tariffs.

      <content:encoded>&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;LIV Golf’s spending spree has seemingly come to an end, but the PGA Tour is chipping in record purses, helping the sport’s 10 top earners score $612 million over the past year.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the past year, no golfer&lt;/strong&gt; has dominated quite like Scottie Scheffler. Since last year’s U.S. Open, the 28-year-old American has won six events and racked up an astonishing $67 million in on-course earnings, including the $25 million bonus that came with his FedEx Cup victory. But even with those astronomical winnings—plus an estimated $30 million off the course, for a total haul of $97 million—there is one title that remains just out of Scheffler’s grasp: the world’s highest-paid golfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second consecutive year, that honor belongs to Jon Rahm, who &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; estimates pulled in $102 million over the past 12 months before taxes and agents’ fees. The 30-year-old Spaniard hasn’t come close to matching Scheffler’s production on the course, winning only two LIV Golf events over the past year, but his decision to switch tours is still paying massive dividends. Rahm’s earnings total includes an estimated $50 million annual payment from the Saudi-backed LIV as part of the reported $300 million guarantee he received to defect from the PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after LIV arrived on the golf scene, Bryson DeChambeau (No. 8 on the list of the world’s highest-paid golfers with total estimated income of $45 million) and Phil Mickelson (No. 10, $40 million) are among the other stars still collecting paychecks from nine-figure guarantees, along with Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Cameron Smith, who fell short of the earnings top 10 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet LIV’s spending spree has seemingly come to an end, with no new high-priced acquisitions since Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton joined up ahead of the 2024 season. And without a fresh set of lucrative signing bonuses, the world’s 10 best-paid golfers are collectively making less—an estimated $612 million, down 10% from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2024/06/12/worlds-highest-paid-golfers-2024-jon-rahm-rory-mcilroy-scottie-scheffler/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2024/06/12/worlds-highest-paid-golfers-2024-jon-rahm-rory-mcilroy-scottie-scheffler/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2024’s $678 million&lt;/a&gt; and 19% from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2023/06/09/the-worlds-highest-paid-golfers-2023/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2023/06/09/the-worlds-highest-paid-golfers-2023/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2023’s record $752 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PGA Tour is certainly doing its part to prop up that total, offering $366.9 million in prize money for the 2025 regular season as it competes with LIV for talent. The figure represents a 1% increase from the prior year and is up a modest 11% since the 2021-22 season’s $330.3 million, but the jump comes out to a heftier 39% on a per-event basis, with the calendar narrowing from 40 regular-season tournaments to 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding in golf’s four majors, the FedEx Cup playoffs and the Comcast Business Tour Top 10, a bonus pool that rewards regular-season performance, PGA golfers are expected to compete for nearly $700 million this calendar year. While that would be a drop from the $728 million total of 2024, the gap stems from the PGA Tour’s move to replace the $50 million Player Impact Program—which rewarded superstar golfers for the buzz they generated—with the Player Equity Program, a new initiative that in 2025 will grant qualifying members stakes worth a combined $930 million in the tour’s for-profit commercial entity, PGA Tour Enterprises. (Those awards are not reflected on the highest-paid golfers list, which counts only cash compensation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some golfers also boosted their pay this year with the newly launched TGL, the indoor golf league cofounded by Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and media executive Mike McCarley. In its inaugural season, the competition awarded $21 million in prize money, and many of the TGL’s top signings are believed to have received seven-figure bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifting prize pools have rebalanced the composition of golf’s top 10 earners, with the PGA Tour now claiming six spots and LIV four—the first time in LIV’s existence that it has made up less than half the ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the sport goes from here is somewhat uncertain. LIV is in the early days of a regime change after replacing former commissioner and CEO Greg Norman with veteran sports executive Scott O’Neil in January and poaching Aston Villa FC president of business operations Chris Heck to become its president this month. The tour has also added broadcast deals with Fox and DAZN and welcomed new brand partners, including Salesforce and PING, which is sponsoring LIV’s Torque GC team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the PGA Tour, Europe’s DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund still have not hammered out a deal for the new for-profit entity they agreed to form in June 2023. Earlier this year, the PIF offered to invest $1.5 billion into PGA Tour Enterprises, the tour’s commercial entity, but was rebuffed, with the Saudis’ insistence that LIV continue to operate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/03/golf-liv-series-pga-tour-reunification-talks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/03/golf-liv-series-pga-tour-reunification-talks&quot;&gt;proving a sticking point&lt;/a&gt;, according to a report by the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if LIV is done handing out massive signing bonuses, it’s a major player in golf’s biggest skins game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World’s Highest-Paid Golfers 2025 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#1.&lt;strong&gt; $102 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jon-rahm/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jon-rahm/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Rahm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;LIV&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$92 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$10 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6847174cb8fc2d0f0f9b313b/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;LIV golfer Jon Rahm.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Richard Heathcote/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rahm’s first year with LIV, in 2024, he won the tour’s season-long individual title—and the $18 million bonus that came with it—even though he didn’t claim his first victory until his 11th event. Thus far in 2025, Rahm is third in the individual standings, recording three top-five finishes in eight tournaments. Off the course, his earnings have significantly declined since he left the PGA Tour. While he once collected an estimated $25 million from endorsements annually, he is now believed to be making less than half that mark from a portfolio of brands that includes Callaway, Rolex and Santander Bank, which sponsors his LIV team, Legion XIII, through its Openbank subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#2. &lt;strong&gt;$97 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/scottie-scheffler/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/scottie-scheffler/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scottie Scheffler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$67 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$30 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/68471765b2e5751c80e194dd/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Scottie Scheffler with the PGA Championship trophy.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Andrew Redington/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After piling up six tournament victories in the first half of 2024, including the Masters, Scheffler added Olympic gold in Paris and then titles at the Tour Championship and the Hero World Challenge to close out the year. He is on a similar trajectory in 2025, having won three events, including the third major title of his career at the PGA Championship in May. The success seems to be attracting new fans: Last week, following Scheffler’s four-stroke win at the Memorial Tournament, CBS announced that the final round had averaged 3.06 million viewers and was the most streamed non-major golf event ever on the Paramount+ streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#3. &lt;strong&gt;$84 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/rory-mcilroy/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/rory-mcilroy/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rory McIlroy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;36&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$39 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$45 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/68471783b8fc2d0f0f9b313d/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Rory McIlroy.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;David Cannon/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIlroy claimed his first green jacket in dramatic fashion in April, defeating Justin Rose in a playoff to win the Masters. The victory, three years after a heartbreaking second-place finish at the tournament, placed McIlroy in rare company, as the sixth golfer to complete the modern-era Grand Slam with a victory at all four major tournaments, after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. In addition to his traditional endorsements, which include Nike, Optum and TaylorMade, McIlroy in May announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/business/dealbook/rory-mcilroy-tpg-sports.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/business/dealbook/rory-mcilroy-tpg-sports.html&quot;&gt;launch of a new sports fund&lt;/a&gt; in a partnership between his investment firm, Symphony Ventures, and private equity outfit TPG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#4. &lt;strong&gt;$55 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/tiger-woods/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/tiger-woods/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;49&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$10 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$45 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/68471798b21e4b7d0bc47f34/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Tiger Woods.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Douglas P.

But he has plenty to keep him busy. In 2024, Woods parted ways with longtime sponsor Nike after 27 years and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2024/01/08/where-tiger-woods-may-go-next-after-ending-his-500-million-nike-partnership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2024/01/08/where-tiger-woods-may-go-next-after-ending-his-500-million-nike-partnership/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;an estimated $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in earnings to launch his own apparel brand, Sun Day Red, in partnership with TaylorMade. This year, the TGL golf league he cofounded with Rory McIlroy began play with an encouraging first season that drew an average of 513,000 viewers for its weekly broadcasts, according to Nielsen. The number peaked at 1.05 million in Week 2 when Woods and his squad, Jupiter Links GC, made their season debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#5. &lt;strong&gt;$50 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/collin-morikawa/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/collin-morikawa/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collin Morikawa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$33 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$17 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684717b3b12494b6aadb5d45/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Collin Morikawa.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tracy Wilcox/PGA TOUR/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morikawa is currently the No. 4-ranked golfer in the world, a testament to his consistency considering he hasn’t won a PGA Tour event since October 2023. He has come awfully close twice this season, however, placing second at the Sentry in January and at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. The two-time major champion will try to turn around his luck this week at the U.S. Open, a tournament where his best finish has been fourth, in 2021. Still, the drought hasn’t stopped him from profiting off his 11 partnerships, with brands such as Adidas, Kowa and TaylorMade. Morikawa was also featured prominently in the first season of Netflix documentary series &lt;em&gt;Full Swing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#6. &lt;strong&gt;$49 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/joaquin-niemann/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/joaquin-niemann/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joaquin Niemann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;LIV&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;Chile&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$47 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$2 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684717f4fdfe0ac5f980b018/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;LIV golfer Joaquin Niemann.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Thananuwat Srirasant/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niemann has been LIV’s most dominant player in 2025, winning events in Adelaide, Singapore, Mexico and Virginia. He leads the tour with $16.8 million in individual prize money and sits at No. 1 in the season points standings, ahead of Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm. The 26-year-old Chilean is still looking for his first major title, but he seems to be making progress: He placed eighth at this year’s PGA Championship, his best finish at one of the four tournaments. Niemann will also have the chance to better that result at the U.S. Open after the USGA in February announced an exemption for the top LIV golfer who hadn’t qualified for the tournament otherwise—the first direct path to a major for the Saudi-backed tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#7. &lt;strong&gt;$48 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/xander-schauffele/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/xander-schauffele/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xander Schauffele&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;31&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$28 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$20 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684717c6531d13fa3733bba8/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Xander Schauffele.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Michael Reaves/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schauffele’s 2025 isn’t off to a hot start, with an eighth-place finish at the Masters representing his best finish this year. But he’s still riding the momentum of a banner 2024, which saw him collect his first two major titles, at the PGA Championship and the British Open, and a career-best $18.4 million in official prize money. Off the course, Schauffele has reshaped his portfolio of brand partners, adding Blue Owl Capital and the Kentucky Derby this year to a group that already included Callaway, Descente and Avis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#8. &lt;strong&gt;$45 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/bryson-dechambeau/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/bryson-dechambeau/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryson DeChambeau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;LIV&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;31&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$42 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$3 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684717de5e0a72f30715da48/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;LIV golfer Bryson DeChambeau with the 2024 U.S. Open trophy.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jared C.

In January, Reebok agreed to a long-term partnership with his team, Crushers GC, and named DeChambeau the “official face of Reebok Golf apparel and footwear offerings.” The 2020 and 2024 U.S. Open champion also has partnerships with Rolex and NetJets and is one of the sport’s most popular players, especially among younger fans, thanks in part to his robust YouTube channel. Last year, a video he posted of a round of golf with President Donald Trump drew 15 million views, and he now has more than 2 million subscribers and 343 million total views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#9. &lt;strong&gt;$42 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/hideki-matsuyama/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/hideki-matsuyama/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hideki Matsuyama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;PGA&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;33&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$17 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$25 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/68471b378894d5b145413f5b/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;PGA Tour golfer Hideki Matsuyama.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Joe Robbins/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Matsuyama won the Genesis Invitational and the FedEx St. Jude Championship and picked up a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, representing his native Japan. He carried the momentum into 2025 with a victory at the Sentry in January, but since then, he has missed the cut three times. Those momentary struggles aside, Matsuyama is still the world’s ninth-ranked golfer and remains highly popular across the Pacific, with a sponsor portfolio filled with Japanese companies including Lexus, Nomura Financial, NTT Data, Srixon and Tokyo Electron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;#10. &lt;strong&gt;$40 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/phil-mickelson/?list=golfers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link target-blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/phil-mickelson/?list=golfers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;subhead4-embed color-body bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tour: &lt;strong&gt;LIV&lt;/strong&gt; | Age: &lt;strong&gt;54&lt;/strong&gt; | Nationality: &lt;strong&gt;U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; | On-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$38 million&lt;/strong&gt; | Off-Course: &lt;strong&gt;$2 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6847181f401596b6699f595b/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;LIV golfer Phil Mickelson.&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Petter Arvidson/Bildbyran/Sipa USA/Newscom&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than halfway through his fourth season as a LIV golfer, Mickelson has yet to secure his first victory on the breakaway circuit.

It is surrounded by multi-million dollar luxury landed homes known as good class bungalows and several embassies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Malaysian King’s property in the Tyersall Avenue area has been held by the family for more than a century. Once the deal with the Singapore government is completed, the family will own about 16.6 hectares, which analysts estimate could be worth at least S$3.6 billion ($2.8 billion).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;h2 class=&quot;topline-heading&quot;&gt;Topline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk said Wednesday he regrets some of the posts he made on X last week bashing President Donald Trump, a significant climbdown by the billionaire who triggered a feud with the president last week by attacking his signature spending bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/684936f2f6b7df9b955f5818/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=1794&amp;amp;cropY1=0&amp;amp;cropY2=1008&quot; alt=&quot;TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk said he regrets his posts attacking President Donald Trump last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key Facts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts-element&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1932695486684950962&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1932695486684950962&quot;&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Musk wrote: “I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week,” adding, “They went too far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts-element&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire’s latest post is the first time he has directly expressed regret about his flurry of posts attacking Trump last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts-element&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Musk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/09/musks-anger-toward-trump-appears-to-cool/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/09/musks-anger-toward-trump-appears-to-cool/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;appeared to signal&lt;/a&gt; he was backing away from the feud by first quietly deleting incendiary tweets alleging Trump’s name was in the “Epstein files” and another one endorsing Trump’s impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;key-facts-element&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire has also appeared to express support for the Trump administration’s response to the anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, as he reshared a Truth Social post by Trump attacking California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;How Has Tesla’s Stock Reacted To Musk’s Latest Tweet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares rose 2.67% in premarket Wednesday to $335 after Musk’s apology. The electric car maker’s stock had taken a severe beating last week as the feud between the president and the world’s richest person escalated. However, the latest premarket bump has pushed the stock’s price back to the level it was on June 4, a day before the two publicly feuded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;What Has Trump Said About The Musk’s Attempt To Cool The Feud?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president had not reacted to Musk’s latest tweet as of early Wednesday. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump said about Musk: “I would think that if I were him, I’d want to speak to me. But, and maybe he has already called, you’d have to ask him, ask him whether or not he’s already called.” He later added: “Look, I wish him well...You understand, we had a good relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk, who left his role as a Trump administration “special government employee” late last month, has since attacked the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” backed by the president and the House GOP. However, on Thursday, Musk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/07/the-musk-vs-trump-feud-musk-deletes-tweet-linking-president-to-epstein-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/07/the-musk-vs-trump-feud-musk-deletes-tweet-linking-president-to-epstein-files/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;aimed his attacks directly&lt;/a&gt; at Trump by first sharing older clips of the president bashing Republicans for raising the debt ceiling. Trump shot back by telling reporters he believes Musk may have “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” a phrase he regularly uses to attack critics. This triggered a back-and-forth between the two former allies as Trump threatened to scrap the government contracts and subsidies granted to Musk-owned companies, while the Tesla CEO alleged, without evidence, the release of the so-called “Epstein Files” was being held back as Trump’s name was allegedly in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/09/musks-anger-toward-trump-appears-to-cool/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/09/musks-anger-toward-trump-appears-to-cool/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Musk’s Anger Toward Trump Appears To Cool&lt;/a&gt; (Forbes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/07/the-musk-vs-trump-feud-musk-deletes-tweet-linking-president-to-epstein-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/06/07/the-musk-vs-trump-feud-musk-deletes-tweet-linking-president-to-epstein-files/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Musk Vs.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 292 aerial targets, while an additional 187 were neutralized by electronic warfare systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian authorities reported no major civilian damage or casualties from the record-breaking attack, though missile debris and impact sites were recorded at 27 locations across the country. The strike came just days after a large-scale assault on June 6 that killed several civilians and rescue workers in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other regions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the strike’s primary targets appeared to be an airfield near the western city of Dubno in Rivne province, which was operational after &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/H4LEClY84ru0VlvLh9hDhz3etZ?domain=facebook.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reportedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; being restored in 2020. All four Kinzhal missiles were directed toward Dubno, where they were intercepted by advanced air defenses, such as the U.S.-made Patriot system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack on Dubno came amid reports of Ukrainian drones striking deep into Russian territory that same night. Around 50 drones targeted multiple military sites in Russia, including a drone production facility and an airbase in Savasleyka, approximately 218 miles east of Moscow, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/yZusCmZ74vfBgqrvhBiQhR3RIB?domain=facebook.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;two aircraft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine reported no casualties in the overnight barrage, sustained &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/sHX2Cn5G4wcAPVYncZsohJwHM8?domain=facebook.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Russian forces on Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region later on June 9 resulted in one civilian death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War Developments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces are pushing from Ukraine’s besieged eastern region of Donetsk to the outskirts of Ukraine’s central and strategically critical Dnipropetrovsk region, &lt;/strong&gt;sparking conflicting narratives from Moscow and Kyiv. On June 9, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/O8hVCqxA4zfKEvo9cqCLhEBeBW?domain=bbc.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a Russian advance into Dnipropetrovsk, purportedly aimed at establishing a “buffer zone,” while Ukrainian officials, including Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s disinformation center, &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/jyTXCrkg4AsPkOGxhQFkh4R6fb?domain=t.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dismissed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the claims as false. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/JHvWCv2m4GtpYZ3viwHEhQw7k3?domain=t.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Russian Defense Ministry on June 8 claimed that elements of the 90th Tank Division had reached the western border of the Donetsk region, or oblast, and were conducting offensive operations into Dnipropetrovsk oblast, territory Russia has not officially annexed. However, Ukraine’s General Staff denied that Russian troops had crossed the administrative border, asserting that fighting remains confined to border villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central Ukrainian oblast of Dnipropetrovsk borders the eastern Donetsk oblast, over two-thirds of which remains under Russian occupation. Ukrainian open-source intelligence group Deep State &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kTkyCwpn4JfJqnWoclIRhJxyiv?domain=deepstatemap.live&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;indicates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Russian forces have advanced to within roughly 1.2 miles of the region’s administrative boundary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Uvh-Cxko4Ksn7j3ZHxSPhy45EV?domain=understandingwar.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Institute for the Study of War&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ISW), Russian tactical activity near the southeastern edge of Dnipropetrovsk is largely a continuation of offensive operations in the Donetsk region rather than a new major push to seize significant territory in Dnipropetrovsk itself. Satellite imagery and heat data confirm ongoing artillery fire near the border but no confirmed Russian foothold inside Dnipropetrovsk oblast as of early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia and Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/PO1hCyPpgLfq83RYugTLhxA9Uj?domain=reuters.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;commenced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a major prisoner-of-war exchange on June 9, beginning with those under 25 years of age.&lt;/strong&gt; This multistage exchange, emerging from direct negotiations held in Istanbul on June 2, is set to involve at least 1,200 POWs from each side, alongside the repatriation of the remains of thousands of fallen soldiers. Neither side disclosed the exact number of prisoners released so far, citing security concerns. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/4rkHCzpqjMfQkzAKTxUQh9VecC?domain=t.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the exchange will continue “over the coming days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an interview with independent Hungarian weekly Valasz Online, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy underscored that the outcome of the war hinges more on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/eFJqCDkwn3sNEZkXuEhkhjS0CE?domain=valaszonline.hu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;weapons and technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; than manpower&lt;/strong&gt;, as Ukraine mobilizes 27,000 soldiers monthly compared to Russia’s 40,000-50,000. “Mobilization is a problem in every war. Ukraine is no exception…people are getting tired,” Zelenskyy said, emphasizing that Russia’s higher losses drive its greater conscription numbers. He further noted that Ukraine has avoided drafting 18-24-year-olds, offering them one-year contracts instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Danylo Nosov, Karina L. Tahiliani&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Loudon has said Barron Trump, 18, is his “best friend,” and he is a regular visitor of the Trump family’s Mar-a-Lago property, according to pictures shared on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/boloudon/?hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/boloudon/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.

Loudon is the son of Gina Loudon, a conservative commentator who co-chaired the Women for Trump organization in 2020, and John William Loudon, a former Missouri state senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;Tangent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lame’s detainment comes amid growing protests targeting ICE across the United States, particularly in Los Angeles, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/06/10/los-angeles-protests-live-updates-trump-claims-city-would-be-burning-unless-troops-deployed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/06/10/los-angeles-protests-live-updates-trump-claims-city-would-be-burning-unless-troops-deployed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; broke out over the weekend after authorities detained dozens of immigrants. Trump has clashed with Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass over his decision to send National Guard troops to quell protests against officials’ wishes. National Guard troops have already arrived in the city, and Trump has ordered hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/09/us/la-protests-immigration-ice-trump?smid=url-share#739f8ac5-ee80-53f3-a779-0ddac5a56967&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/09/us/la-protests-immigration-ice-trump?smid=url-share#739f8ac5-ee80-53f3-a779-0ddac5a56967&quot;&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; to the city, which could reportedly arrive as soon as Tuesday. Officials and some legal scholars have challenged Trump’s authority to mobilize the National Guard, though Trump reportedly said in a memo he had invoked Title 10, which permits the president to call on the National Guard if the U.S. is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation” or if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” Since protests broke out in Los Angeles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5341736-anti-ice-protests-pop-up-in-cities-across-the-country/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5341736-anti-ice-protests-pop-up-in-cities-across-the-country/&quot;&gt;more demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; have taken place in cities including New York, Dallas and Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align&quot;&gt;How Much Does Khaby Lame Earn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lame is one of the highest-paid social media creators, according to Forbes estimates.
