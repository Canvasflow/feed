<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-new-issue-of-artists-illustrators-magazine-is-out-now-here-s-everything-you-can-expect-to-see"><strong>The new issue of <em>Artists &amp; Illustrators</em> magazine is out now.</strong> <strong>Here’s everything you can expect to see</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="788" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JulyAI.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34286" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JulyAI.png 940w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JulyAI-300x251.png 300w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JulyAI-768x644.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></figure>



<p>Our July issue is here, packed with expert advice, inspiring stories, and a touch of art history to fuel your practice this summer. Inside, watercolour legend Alvaro Castagnet wraps up his practical series by showing the vital role of edges in your paintings. Jessie Kanelos Wiener follows, applying a similar approach to capture the charm of a Parisian street scene.</p>



<p>For those working in coloured pencil, we feature two artists exploring the same subject in very different styles — a fascinating comparison of technique and expression. Meanwhile, watercolour specialist David Bellamy invites you to try your hand at gouache, sharing tips that make this medium refreshingly approachable. Acrylic painters are well served, too: in our How I Paint feature, Susannah Bleasby offers insight into her expressive florals and landscapes, while cover artist Sarah Fosse brings her bold, showstopping cityscapes to the fore.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1010" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-1010x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34287" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-1010x1024.jpg 1010w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-296x300.jpg 296w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-768x779.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-1515x1536.jpg 1515w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RED-2020x2048.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px" /></figure>



<p>This issue also takes you beyond the easel. Discover the lesser-known visual works of Victor Hugo, celebrated in a major exhibition at the Royal Academy, and explore the exquisite ukiyo-e prints of Utagawa Hiroshige at the British Museum — two landmark shows well worth a summer visit.</p>



<p>Finally, we’re offering readers the chance to win one of two places on an art course at the St Ives School of Painting in Cornwall. A chance to paint in one of the country’s most picturesque settings — an opportunity not to be missed. Pick up your copy or subscribe now. Here’s to a season of creativity and discovery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artist-sarah-spencer-shows-you-how-to-glaze-a-painting-and-the-effects-it-creates">Artist Sarah Spencer shows you how to glaze a painting and the effects it creates</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/uploads/tinymce/images/glazing_tips.jpeg" alt="how to glaze a painting" title="how to glaze a painting"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-glaze-a-painting">Why glaze a painting?</h3>



<p>The difference between the two works above may not seem immediately apparent: the composition, broad colour range and tonality are all similar. The addition of glazes, however, has unified the painting on the right and brought a different intensity and mood to the final image.</p>



<p>After the immediacy and directness of starting a work outside in the landscape, I begin a more contemplative and gradual coaxing of the painting in the studio: working over the initial underpainting, applying successive washes and glazes to the opaque underlying <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/illustration/how-to-illustrate-in-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layers</a>. For me, a painting feels ‘naked’ until I have then built up a series of glazes and washes. Adding these layers brings a depth and subtlety that is absent in the initial stages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-difference-between-a-glaze-and-a-wash">What is the difference between a glaze and a wash?</h3>



<p>A glaze is a transparent layer of thinned paint, whereas a wash is a thinned translucent layer of paint mixed with an opaque pigment such as white.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-effects-can-they-create">What effects can they create?</h3>



<p>The addition of glazes and washes subtly alters the dry colour underneath. The colours do not physically mix: as light passes through the glaze or wash, it is reflected off the opaque layer below, so that the painting may appear to ‘glow’ (in the case of a glaze) or mist over (in the case of a <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/watercolour/how-to-paint-a-graduated-wash-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wash</a>). When colours are mixed via superimposed layers, they achieve a more luminous and mellowed brilliance. They also allow the creation and manipulation of a far more subtle range of colour and tonal relationships.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-apply-them">How do I apply them?</h3>



<p>Both glazes and washes can be created by thinning and extending your oil paint with either a homemade medium consisting of equal parts of linseed oil, turpentine and <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/oil-painting/how-to-make-damar-varnish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damar varnish</a>, or a pre-mixed medium such as Winsor &amp; Newton’s Liquin or Roberson’s Glaze Medium.</p>



<p>A new glaze or wash should be applied with a wide, soft brush when the previous layer is completely dry. A lint-free cloth can be used to wipe off areas of the still-wet glaze if required. Remember that it is not necessary to glaze the whole picture at once – you might use a Burnt Umber glaze to warm up particular parts of a landscape, for example. Washes and glazes can be alternated in successive layers, but I generally always finish with an almost-transparent glaze. I find this sorts out any unevenness in the relative glossiness of a painting’s surface. <strong><em><a href="http://www.sarah-spencer.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sarah-spencer.co.uk</a> </em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" title="juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects" width="500" height="380" src="/uploads/tinymce/images/juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects.jpg" alt="juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects"></h2>



<p>Alice Pattullo is an East London-based illustrator with a knack for bringing British traditions, folklore and quirky sayings to life. Her clients range from <em>Gardens Illustrated</em> and <em>Kew Gardens</em> to <em>Fortnum and Mason</em> and <em>The V&amp;A Museum</em>, and her limited edition screen prints have become a favourite for those who appreciate a good story behind the art. In 2022, Alice launched her first wallpaper collection, <em>Arcadia</em>, inspired by her childhood spent on her parents&#8217; allotment in the Northeast and her pandemic-era walks through London&#8217;s parks. It’s a nostalgic nod to nature, with a side of wit—just like Alice herself. She’s represented by the Central Illustration Agency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-you-mix-fine-art-screenprinting-and-commercial-illustration">How do you mix fine art screenprinting and commercial illustration?</h3>



<p>I see them as two different strings to my bow. The &#8220;fine art&#8221; screenprints are my work as opposed to a commissioned commercial <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-illustrate-a-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">illustration</a> where I am being told what to draw in a confined brief. There is often crossover stylistically and even in subject matter, but the screenprints I exhibit and sell have always been personally driven and researched, and generally are much more esoteric.</p>



<p>The last one was inspired by a bizarre Pathé end-of-pier film of ladies riding horse-shaped bicycles in a race to win a prize. (It is a particularly strange one.) I do them because I want to do them, rather than because I need to sell them. I do occasionally get <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/marketing-your-art/the-working-artist-how-to-work-to-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commissioned</a> to produce prints but I would only agree to this if it was a topic that genuinely interested me and that I feel enthusiastic about.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-decide-which-media-to-work-in-for-illustration-projects">How do I decide which media to work in for illustration projects?</h3>



<p>I always start my drawings in the same way, but then, depending on the outcome, the drawings take a slightly different journey. They all begin as elements in a sketchbook drawn in brush and Indian ink, introducing texture with dry brushes and acrylic, as well as painted <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/watercolour/how-to-paint-textured-beaches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">textures</a> and marks, which I cut out and collage into my drawings to work back into. From this point, I scan all my drawings and start to compose these digitally.</p>



<p>If I’m working on something with a quick turnaround or that’s likely to need edits, such as an editorial illustration, I will colour the image digitally. This simplifies the process if I need to make changes. If I’m working towards a screenprint, I would normally still make the full composition digitally – using all the scanned hand-drawn elements – but then I’d draw the different <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/drawing/how-to-draw-a-portrait-in-layers-with-coloured-pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layers</a>/colours by hand and build it like that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-i-use-a-different-process-based-on-the-subject-matter">Should I use a different process based on the subject matter?</h3>



<p>I don’t think so. I always approach the drawing in the same way – it would just be the research process that might change. The research for a book project is often provided by the publisher, who might have guidance from a museum or a specialist if needed.</p>



<p>For my own work, research takes up a large part of the process. I’ll read lots of books, sift through old scrapbooks/notebooks/sketchbooks for forgotten or lost ideas, make notes, listen to podcasts and go to galleries. I generally have a vague starting point in mind that I want to research and I’ll let it grow organically from there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/uploads/tinymce/images/how-to-juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects-2.jpg" alt="how-to-juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects" title="how-to-juggle-commercial-and-personal-projects"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-research-should-i-do-for-book-projects">How much research should I do for book projects?</h3>



<p>The books I have worked on have been very much a collaborative project. I have provided illustrations for an author’s text – as opposed to working on a self-authored picture book – so the editor or writer will usually help with the research and provide me with a folder of images and information to work from so that my illustrations are accurate. The last few books I’ve worked on have been non-fiction <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/still-life/how-to-embrace-natural-light-in-your-garden-with-sian-dudley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural </a>history books for children. While the publisher wants you to bring your artistic licence to the pages, the illustrations still need to be scientifically accurate to a certain degree.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-use-lots-of-vibrant-colours-how-should-i-decide-on-a-palette-for-an-individual-print-and-or-a-book-project">You use lots of vibrant colours. How should I decide on a palette for an individual print and/or a book project?</h3>



<p>I collect a lot of old 1930-50s lithographed children’s books that I often return to if I need some inspiration for colour. The oil-based ink used in these has such an amazing quality and vibrancy that I love. I also have scrapbooks and cuttings from magazines or snippets of fabric that I have saved because I see a nice colour combination.</p>



<p>I have been making prints for quite a while now, and I generally feel like I revisit certain colour combinations just in varying hues and strengths. Sometimes you just get an intuitive feel for something rather than consciously making a decision. For a book project, I might still limit my <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/watercolour/how-to-choose-your-colour-palette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">palette</a> but the limitations are more likely to be dictated by what colours I definitely need to make something look accurate, rather than by my own whims.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-you-get-so-much-detail-into-a-screenprint-what-is-the-process">How do you get so much detail into a screenprint? What is the process?</h3>



<p>The process always takes the same route. I essentially draw and design everything I do as though it is going to be screenprinted to provide me with the option to do so if I want. I now work with an editioning print studio, The Print Block, on my screenprints because this was a process I could delegate to allow myself more time to physically <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/drawing/how-to-draw-a-bird-in-coloured-pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">draw</a>, which is the part of the creative process I most enjoy.</p>



<p>It has been great to develop a working relationship with Suki, the printer there. It takes a lot of trust – and confidence on her part – to pass your work over to someone else to “complete.” I was very tentative at first, and I imagine a very annoying client, but now completely trust her to match my colours correctly or layer things in a certain way and so on when printing. It has been an extremely rewarding collaborative process.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-artists-do-you-look-to-for-inspiration">What artists do you look to for inspiration?</h3>



<p>I have always been particularly interested in mid-20th-century British designers. Many of the image-makers – Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious, Barnett Freedman, John Nash, Barbara Jones and Enid Marx – were straddling both the fine art world and the commercial illustration, design and advertising world, which is what I think makes both sides of their work so interesting and vibrant. These artists would be producing painted murals and watercolour landscapes, as well as bold graphic advertising schemes for companies such as Shell, TFL and the GPO. This is a balance I strive for in my own work, which is why I make sure to keep up my own research and make prints alongside my commissioned work.</p>



<p>Because of printing constraints at the time these artists developed a really strong use of colour and were able to only usually only around four at a time. It was vital to consider overlaps and colour co-ordinations to make the most out of the little you had. Although technically there are no constraints for printing now, I adopt this ethos of a limited colour palette. I actually think it helps me consider the actual drawing more working with less <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/drawing/how-to-draw-a-bird-in-coloured-pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colour</a>.</p>



<p>Two artists of this era in particular, Enid Marx and Barbara Jones, collected, researched, drew and wrote about their collections – namely folk and popular art – and you can see how they research the crafts and practices which influenced their own creative style. I like to think I have a bit of that, but I guess I am also taking advantage of their own well-cataloged and illustrated collections for my own inspiration too.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34266" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3014-4-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Growing up, I developed a fascination with human facial structure early on, sketching portraits and people from a young age. My parents were very encouraging in my desire to draw and create; always investing in art materials for me. I still remember the first time I picked up <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/featured-artist/how-to-draw-an-animal-in-charcoal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charcoal </a>and tried to use it like graphite. I hated it and completely failed.  </p>



<p>In high school and college, the life drawing courses I took required me to sketch gesture drawings in charcoal. As I learned the more expressive, less fine-tuned approach compared to <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/drawing/how-to-draw-with-graphite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphite</a>, I fell in love with the material. Art for me was only a way of life, I did not see it as a career or job and wasn’t sure whether it would be realistic to pursue it, especially while being very dedicated to college soccer ( or football, for those elsewhere in the world). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34264" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1710-2-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Seeking an enjoyable and creative career, I sought to make a living in what seemed to be more of a sustainable and realistic goal of becoming a graphic designer. After not drawing or painting for five years, I revisited the lost love of charcoal <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/pastels/how-to-create-a-figure-drawing-with-soft-pastels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawing</a>, sharing my process along with the final artwork. Immediately, I started earning millions of views since the very first video; something I had never experienced before. Viral video after viral video, the demand for my work grew and thus my art career was manifested almost overnight.</p>



<p>I am very grateful for the opportunities brought by the exposure to social media. Since all of what I have acquired in the world has been very organic, I am reluctant to create anything that I feel is not my personal, desired work.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34265" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0925-2-1-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Interestingly, art has further allowed my wife, Jordan and I to sculpt our life around this career, as she helps manage the business as well. I am beyond grateful to work from my home <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/featured-artist/in-the-studio-with-jonathan-yeo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio</a> and cherish my family’s presence so much of the day. </p>



<p>I would love to seek out a gallery in Europe to host my work, as well as Los Angeles and New York for the long term. That, along with releasing my own personal ‘Mad Charcoal’ art materials brand later this year. Be on the lookout. <em><a href="http://madcharcoal.com">madcharcoal.com </a></em></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="789" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-789x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34260" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-789x1024.jpg 789w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-231x300.jpg 231w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-768x997.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-1183x1536.jpg 1183w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-1577x2048.jpg 1577w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nosey-scaled.jpg 1972w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></figure>



<p>Before Holly, we always had Labradors. But on this occasion, we decided to put our ‘do-gooders’ hats on and rehome a rescue dog. After much discussion, we thought the gentle nature of the greyhound would probably suit our family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holly is very quick and is referred to as a sighthound. This is quite a revelation as a new sighthound owner. She will fix on something, and although you can’t see it, she can. Holly can see up to a mile away, in 270 degrees, meaning she can see motion behind her, and has ‘stereoscopic vision.’ So, neighbourhood watch is right up her <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/ink/how-to-create-a-street-scene-in-mixed-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">street</a>. Hence, the painting title, <em>Nosey</em>. </p>



<p>For this piece, I took a picture of her mid-gaze nose, a little twisted to the side, like she does when concentrating. This painting is important because ultimately, I would like to create a very large piece and <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-create-a-portrait-in-pastels/">pastel</a> lends itself to that perfectly. Pastel can smudge so easily and I wanted to keep a very contemporary clean look. I am entranced by the vibrancy of pastel pigments and the smooth laydown.</p>



<p>I hope that anyone who looks at this piece gets that feeling of her looking right at them, 100% focused. I hope it speaks to people of the stunning supermodel-esque looks of my sugar-coated, kind soul, Holly.<br><em><a href="http://hazeljohnsonartist.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hazeljohnsonartist.com</a></em></p>

<p>Whenever my son, Meilir, comes home from university, we often head across the border to Burton on The Wirral, where the salt marsh along the River Dee offers a peaceful escape. Flocks of wading birds fly overhead, and the bright Stonechat stands out in every season, symbolising endurance and hope. Inspired by the beauty of the landscape, I wanted to take my <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-paint-bird-watercolour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bird</a> studies further, and coloured pencil became my preferred technique. Having been discouraged from painting as a child, I find coloured pencil more efficient and manageable. Faber Castell Polychromos is my choice, and I keep my set always ready for whenever inspiration strikes.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-know-your-subject">1. Know Your Subject</h3>



<p>Drawing from photographs is great, but sketching from life helps you understand what you’re drawing. At art college, we did basic taxidermy to understand form and aid with reference. You don’t need to go that far; just <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-sketch-a-window-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sketch</a> and observe from life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="839" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coloured-pencil-bird-839x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34231" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coloured-pencil-bird-839x1024.png 839w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coloured-pencil-bird-246x300.png 246w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coloured-pencil-bird-768x937.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coloured-pencil-bird.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-preparation-and-layout">2. Preparation and Layout</h3>



<p>Sometimes, I see a version of the final piece in my head before I begin. I usually draw freehand, but if needed, I trace from reference photos and transfer the image onto my paper or board. Just draw guidelines that you can easily remove. I use a Blackwing 602 pencil on an A3 Seawhite of Brighton Art Board sheet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="767" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-coloured-pencils-767x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34232" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-coloured-pencils-767x1024.png 767w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-coloured-pencils-225x300.png 225w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-coloured-pencils-768x1025.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-coloured-pencils.png 1086w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-start-in-the-middle">3. Start in the Middle</h3>



<p>I begin with the main subject, drawing the details of the Stonechat and laying down basic colours with coloured pencils. Observation is key; it needs to look alive. It’s all about the life in the <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-paint-piercing-blue-eyes-in-watercolour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye</a>, not just a simple white highlight but the reflection of its surroundings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="597" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-1024x597.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34233" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-1536x895.jpg 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-the-landscape-1-2048x1194.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-the-context">4. The Context</h3>



<p>Even if this was just a study of the male Stonechat, adding context is important. I’ve previously drawn this species for an identification guide and perched it on a sprig of gorse. Even that gives an idea of its habitat. The mountain is a vital part of the composition. Indanthrene Blue is wonderful for creating a sense of distance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="616" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-1024x616.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34234" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-1024x616.png 1024w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-300x180.png 300w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-768x462.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-1536x923.png 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-drawing-bird-2048x1231.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-grounding-the-subject-in-the-landscape">5. Grounding the Subject in the Landscape</h3>



<p>The fresh but spiky bramble grounds the bird in the picture. The fresh greens and reds indicate the time of year, while the thorns reinforce the bird’s defiant presence. Using Sky Blue, I create the summer sky. Clouds are essential in pencil pieces because large flat expanses of colour are tricky.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="736" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-drawing-birds-736x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34235" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-drawing-birds-736x1024.png 736w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-drawing-birds-216x300.png 216w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-drawing-birds-768x1068.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-drawing-birds.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-cloudscape-to-landscape">6. Cloudscape to Landscape</h3>



<p>Once I’m happy with the clouds, I lay down background tone with Earth Green Yellowish. I adjust the bramble and Stonechat until I’m satisfied. I don’t aim for photorealism; <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-paint-wildlife-in-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildlife</a> isn’t seen in microscopic detail. I want the bird to look like it could fly off the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="744" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-bird-744x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34236" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-bird-744x1024.png 744w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-bird-218x300.png 218w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-bird-768x1057.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-bird.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-the-background-layout">7. The Background Layout</h3>



<p>I use Indanthrene Blue again to define trees, fields, and hedges in the distant Flintshire countryside. I avoid too much detail in the far distance, increasing it as the landscape moves closer to create depth. Light strokes can always be darkened later if needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="727" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1-727x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34237" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1-727x1024.jpg 727w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1-213x300.jpg 213w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1-768x1082.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1-1091x1536.jpg 1091w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-adding-background-detail-1.jpg 1454w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-moving-closer">8. Moving Closer</h3>



<p>To enhance depth and scale, I add more detail as the landscape moves forward. Different <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/how-to-mix-the-perfect-green/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greens</a>, yellows, and browns bring variation to the far fields. This, along with the direction of the strokes, reinforces perspective. Strengthening shadows helps, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="899" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird-1024x899.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34238" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird-1024x899.png 1024w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird-300x263.png 300w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird-768x674.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird-1536x1348.png 1536w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-coloured-pencil-bird.png 1666w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-tweaks-and-shadows">9. Tweaks and Shadows</h3>



<p>I refine the Stonechat and bramble, ensuring shading is natural. The bramble must appear textured and slightly dangerous. The leaves should be fresh yet realistic. Most importantly, the bird’s feet must appear to grip the branch rather than float.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="767" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10-coloured-pencil-bird-2-767x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34239" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10-coloured-pencil-bird-2-767x1024.png 767w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10-coloured-pencil-bird-2-225x300.png 225w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10-coloured-pencil-bird-2-768x1026.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10-coloured-pencil-bird-2.png 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-the-fun-bit">10. The Fun Bit</h3>



<p>In the foreground, yellow flag iris, waving rushes, and dead thistles emerge in an expanse of grass. Tonally, I transition from yellowish-bright green in the midground to darker, sombre greens at the base, maintaining depth. Caput Mortuum Violet defines the dead stems. The long grass is drawn loosely and quickly. A white pen highlights cotton grass. <a href="https://www.behance.net/mikeroberts2"><em>behance.net/mikeroberts2</em></a></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34210" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>When I sketch and paint, it is less about capturing the precision and exactness of the scene than it is trying to convey the feeling of a place. With my loose, illustrative <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/pastels/how-to-create-a-figure-drawing-with-soft-pastels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawings</a>, I try to show the mood. In this example of a mixed media street scene by the New Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, I want to hint at the movement of the crowds in ink, or the scale and grandeur of the architecture in purposeful, broad pen strokes. I’m a big fan of using as much negative space on the page to tighten and focus the scene.</p>



<p>In terms of colour, I’m equally expressive and interpretive. I’m happier altering a scene’s colour than I am attempting to replicate the colours precisely. Likewise, my brushwork aims to draw out the textures and imperfections of brickwork or the subtle variations in the shades of shadows. All of this results in a fresh, interpretative take on these scenes from around the world, particularly in the case of a mixed media street scene.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34211" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-1-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Inking the background</strong></p>



<p>If you’re using ink, then a good painting is only as good as the drawing. Here, I use a Desiderata Ebonite flex-nib fountain pen with waterproof ink to gently etch in the background, starting with the New Mosque. The trick is not to add too much detail; keep your strokes almost feather-light and gestural, focusing more on the <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/watercolour/how-to-draw-a-building-by-using-shapes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shapes</a> than details. As we move to the mid-ground, I thicken up the line weight more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34212" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-2-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Completing the drawing</strong></p>



<p>I’m more careful with the foreground drawing of this mixed media street scene where I use more delicate and purposeful pen strokes to create detail. A few jet-black lines under the wheels of the cart give the illusion of shadows and a bit of initial weight to the objects. Holding my fountain pen at the very end, I loosely flick ink onto the page to create this nice splatter effect. Make sure it dries fully before moving on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34213" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-3-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>A wash of light</strong></p>



<p>Next, I start with the painting and a first wash focusing on the light values. I use my mop brush and apply a gentle combination of Ultramarine Blue and a dash of Burnt Sienna for the mosque followed by a warmer mixture of Yellow Ochre to the building on the right. This is essentially one big <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/masterclass-how-to-create-a-layered-portrait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layer</a>, so I continue down the page with splashes of colour for the canopy and a nice grey for the road.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34214" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-4-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Adding the sky</strong></p>



<p>I want to keep the building on the right nice and light, so it pops. To do this, I deliberately make the sky darker. A simple mix of Ultramarine Blue and a tiny dash of Alizarin Crimson is all I need on my mop brush to apply a single layer for the sky. I use a generous amount of pigment and then quickly dry it on a sponge before using the side of the brush to apply it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34215" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-5-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Background shadows</strong></p>



<p>It’s now time for the second wash and I start with the background for the mixed media street scene, so it’s back to the mosque. Switching to my sable brush for those more delicate lines, I apply a light shadow using a touch of Lavender, Ultramarine Blue and a dot of Burnt Sienna. I don’t want the <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/watercolour/how-to-paint-shadows-in-watercolour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadows</a> to be too sharp or dark at this stage so that the mosque gets pushed comfortably into the background. Blend with a damp brush if it looks too neat.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34216" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-6-1-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Moving to the mid-ground</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-1 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>By now, I’m thinking all about shadows for that right-hand building. I know these need to be darker and crisper than the background, so I make a thicker mix of Ultramarine Blue and Indigo for under those arches and then vary it up with more Burnt Sienna as I move down. Don’t be afraid to throw a bit of thicker pigment under the arches for a wet-on-wet effect. This will really help sell the depth of the scene later.</p>
</div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34218" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-7-2-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Adding in foreground features</strong></p>



<p>Next, as I’m moving closer to the foreground, I want things to be a little sharper. I mix a nice greeny shadow with Sap Green and Indigo for the bush on the left and then simply add more Ultramarine Blue for the cast shadow across the road. Here, I use the tip of the sable <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/art-theory/how-to-care-for-your-paint-brushes-and-palette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brush</a> to apply the shadow as it typically holds more pigment. I’m careful not to make the road shadow too dark.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34219" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-8-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Shaping the scene</strong></p>



<p>The scene really starts to come together when I add some rich, bright pigment to the cart in the foreground. This was my plan from the beginning and, because I kept the background quite muted, it allows the food cart to really stand out. Just taking Cadmium Yellow and red straight from the pen is all you need here for the canopy, adding in just a dash of water if you think it’s too thick.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-724x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34220" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-724x1024.png 724w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-212x300.png 212w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-768x1086.png 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stage-9-2-1448x2048.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Final touches</strong></p>



<p>The final stage is that ‘aha!’ moment where I wash the foreground cart with a nice shadow, bringing it right to the foreground. A few dashes of paint for the people and shadows for the pavement edge with my rigger brush round off the scene nicely. It’s only right at the end of mixed media street scene watercolour scenes like this that we get that sense of depth and place, with our hard work paying off.</p>

<p>Growing up, art wasn’t just a decorative element for Ewa Schreiber; it was a way of life. “I grew up in a family where art was very much part of everyday life, and I’ve painted for as long as I can remember.” Yet, the realisation that painting could be more than a daily occupation dawned on her after a transformative trip to Scotland. The windswept landscape compelled her to show its beauty to others.</p>



<p>Her journey led to the creation of the Ninfa Fluida Gallery, her online sanctuary for artistic <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/portraits-figurative/how-to-paint-an-expressive-portrait-in-acrylic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expression</a>. Painting since the tender age of three, Ewa’s love for the craft became a constant companion through life’s ups and downs. “It always helped me through difficult times,” she reflects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="864" height="1024" src="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-864x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34192" srcset="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-864x1024.jpg 864w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-253x300.jpg 253w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-768x910.jpg 768w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-1296x1536.jpg 1296w, https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04-Ninfa_Fluida_MochSaMhadainn-1728x2048.jpg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></figure>



<p>Her upbringing, steeped in art, significantly influences her work. Exposed to traditional art from an early age, she drew inspiration from the Pre-Raphaelites, German Romantics and Baltic Symbolists. Despite her love for visual arts, she initially pursued literature, which enhanced her artistic practice. “It helps conceptualise the approach and to become more aware of what you are doing with your art,” she remarks.</p>



<p>Ewa’s focus on symbolist Scottish landscape painting is distinctive. For her, painting a landscape is about making the invisible visible and capturing the feeling of a place. The choice between detailed realism and <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/abstract/7-tips-for-creating-abstract-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abstract</a> representation depends on the emotional resonance of the location. Being based in the culturally rich city of Paris offers her a wealth of artistic resources. Her creative process finds balance by spending time in a village in central France, allowing for both intellectual and emotional work.</p>

<p>The artist’s paintings evoke mystic beauty, whilst her aim is “to replicate the ambiguous feelings experienced in nature – awe and fear, comfort and solitude.” For her, nature is both us and something larger, and her paintings embody the wild nostalgia felt in the vastness of Scottish landscapes. <em>En plein air</em> painting plays a significant role in her creative process, allowing her to absorb the elements and translate the <a href="https://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/how-to/oil-painting/how-to-paint-an-atmospheric-cityscape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atmosphere</a> into the emotional resonance of her pieces. </p>



<p>Ewa emphasises that her work is not limited to lovers of Scotland and aspires to convey the beauty of raw landscapes that transcends borders. She says it’s her dedication to the “truth of the landscape” that sets her apart, rooted in the beauty of the Scottish Highlands engraved in her heart. <em><a href="http://britishartclub.co.uk/profile/NinfaFluidaGallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">britishartclub.co.uk/profile/NinfaFluidaGallery</a></em></p>
