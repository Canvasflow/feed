<![CDATA[ <p role="subtitle">Aprilia has stood firm over <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jorge-martin/109340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Martin</a>&rsquo;s push to be released from his contract early and expects the defending MotoGP world champion to remain at the team at least until the end of 2026, it has said in a statement.</p><p role="example">The Italian manufacturer has remained silent on the matter since Motorsport.com exclusively revealed Martin intended to invoke a clause in his contract to be released from the second year of his deal for 2026, allowing him to leave at the end of the season.</p><p>The agreement signed by Aprilia and Martin last year at the Italian GP is set to hold no binding effect for the second season. Motorsport.com understands that in the version accepted by Aprilia, Martin&rsquo;s representatives included a clause granting him full freedom to accept offers from other teams if he was not among the title contenders after last Sunday&rsquo;s French GP at Le Mans.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/why-martin-vs-aprilia-conflict-will-have-no-easy-resolution/10722628/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0oOzyBx0/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Why Martin-vs-Aprilia conflict will have no easy resolution</a><p>But in a statement released on Thursday ahead of the British GP, Aprilia said its contract with Martin is &ldquo;valid and in effect&rdquo; for its full duration until the end of the 2026 season.</p><p>&ldquo;The contract between Aprilia Racing and Jorge Mart&iacute;n is valid and in effect, and as such, it must be respected by both parties until its expiration (end of 2026). Aprilia Racing has honoured it in full, within the agreed-upon timelines and terms, and will continue to do so in the future,&rdquo; the team statement read.</p> <img draggable="false" src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2QzVA73Y/s1000/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te.jpg" alt="Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Aprilia Racing</p><p>&ldquo;Aprilia Racing denies that any negotiations have taken place between the parties to modify the duration of the contract, which remains as originally agreed upon. The team has no comment on matters that do not directly concern it but expects other teams to refrain from making any kind of offer to riders who are under contract. Such behaviour would, in any case, not be legitimate.</p><p>&ldquo;The entire Team will continue to support Jorge throughout his recovery process, as it always has, and looks forward to seeing him back on track with the RS-GP.&rdquo;</p><p>Aprilia&rsquo;s comment on it &ldquo;expect[ing] other teams to refrain from making any kind of offer to riders who are under contract&rdquo; is believed to be aimed at Honda, which could be Martin&rsquo;s destination if he is released early from his current contract.</p><p>Honda has no intention of making any move until Martin resolves his ongoing conflict with Aprilia and is officially free, while Aprilia boss Massimo Rivola held a meeting with Hikaru Tsukamoto, his Honda counterpart, at Le Mans.</p><p>The situation is remarkable following Martin&rsquo;s switch to Aprilia as reigning MotoGP world champion after winning the title last year with Pramac Ducati.</p><p>Two pre-season injuries sidelined Martin from the first three rounds in Thailand, Argentina and Austin, and he returned in Qatar, still not fully recovered, only to suffer a serious injury that resulted in nearly two weeks of hospital treatment in Doha due to a pneumothorax.</p><p>While a return to action date hasn&rsquo;t been set yet, it seems unlikely he will be fit to return before the German GP, the 11th round, scheduled for 11-13 July.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Will Monaco provide the clean weekend Yuki Tsunoda needs at Red Bull? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Japanese racer <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/828523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuki Tsunoda</a> was promoted to Red Bull from <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/racing-bulls-12/12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racing Bulls</a> after just two grands prix in the 2025 Formula 1 season. His target was simple &ndash; score points and support the team in its fight against <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>. But since making the move up, Tsunoda struggled to put together a clean race weekend, with crashes and disappointing finishes threatening his standing at the cut-throat outfit.&nbsp;</p><p>Tsunoda replaced New Zealander <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/liam-lawson/451769/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Lawson</a> at Red Bull after the rookie failed to live up to its lofty expectations. In his first two races for the team, the Kiwi crashed out and finished 12th, so all Tsunoda had to do was manage better than this.&nbsp;</p><p>He has, but only just. So far, his five race-stint with Red Bull earned him a best finish of 9th and he picked up only four world championship points. In contrast, team-mate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> claimed two race wins and 88 points over the same five grands prix &ndash; not including sprints.&nbsp;</p><p>In Imola, the gulf between Verstappen and Tsunoda was plain to see. The Japanese racer crashed violently in the first stage of qualifying, with the damage meaning he would start the grand prix from the pitlane. Verstappen, in contrast, placed second.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a big accident,&rdquo; said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner at the Emilia Romagna GP. &ldquo;The most important thing with that was that he jumped out of it OK.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99krKGY/s1000/car-of-yuki-tsunoda-red-bull-r.jpg" alt="Car of Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Car of Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Franco Nugnes</p><p>Tsunoda took full responsibility for the crash, which required a complete rebuild of his RB21, and he <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/yuki-tsunoda-stupid-imola-qualifying-crash/10723785/" target="_self" rel="noopener">described the incident as &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;</a>. The narrow nature of the Imola track meant the accident ruined Tsunoda&rsquo;s chances of a strong result and left Verstappen fighting the leading McLarens without a wingman on side to support his, and the team&rsquo;s, campaign for F1&rsquo;s titles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The constructors&rsquo; is very much a long shot at the moment,&rdquo; added Horner. &ldquo;So, all our focus is on the drivers&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;But having him [Tsunoda] in play, again, is really important. It's a shame because he drove a good race today. If he'd have started in position, he would have been much further up. And hopefully that will come over the coming races.&rdquo;</p><p>And to be fair to Tsunoda, he did run a good race in Imola. He climbed through the ranks to finish 10th on the road, picking up another point to add to his tally. Up to this point, the most positions the Japanese driver made in a grand prix was just two during his rise from 14th to 12th in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>Horner&rsquo;s praise after the Imola race was echoed by Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko, who said: &ldquo;Congratulations! So next time without an accident&rdquo; when he spied the Japanese driver in the paddock.</p><p>Tsunoda himself said the recovery drive was a step in the right direction for his confidence at Red Bull. But the racer admitted that he should have started higher up the order if he wanted to play the team game.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes you have to step back and build the confidence gradually,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because in this kind of environment, it's easy to overpush and put myself under a lot of pressure. I have to rethink myself.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0oOy7R70/s1000/yuki-tsunoda-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>&ldquo;I'm happy that I was able to build up the confidence in the race. For sure, my progress is continuing. There's still a lot of room to improve for sure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tsunoda&rsquo;s start with Red Bull hasn&rsquo;t been an easy one. He joined the team with a baptism of fire at his home grand prix, before facing fearsome, narrow tracks in Saudi Arabia and Miami. Even with a return to purpose-built circuits like Imola, the Japanese driver had to contend with a tight track that was tough to pass on.&nbsp;</p><p>After races like this, and the results he achieved, Tsunoda needs a clean race weekend to prove to Red Bull that he is the step up the team expects. So far, incidents like his crash with Perre Gasly in Saudi Arabia and his finish outside the points in Japan aren&rsquo;t helping his chances.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, his strong recovery in Imola will have gone some way to calm any nerves Tsunoda or the Red Bull bosses may have &ndash; but his next race in Monaco could be the real test of his confidence in the car.&nbsp;</p><p>The tight city streets, close walls and lack of runoffs mean that mistakes are quickly punished in the principality. What&rsquo;s more, an out-of-position Red Bull will find it difficult carving through the pack on the narrow circuit, no matter how comfortable the driver is feeling at the wheel.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2d195aZY/s1000/yuki-tsunoda-rb-f1-team-vcarb-.jpg" alt="Yuki Tsunoda, RB F1 Team VCARB 01" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Yuki Tsunoda, RB F1 Team VCARB 01</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>Tsunoda is adamant that he &ldquo;moved on already&rdquo; after his Imola crash, which is evidenced by his strong race day performance. But the Japanese racer admitted that there was &ldquo;something still in my head&rdquo; after the crash, which may not bode well for his hopes of a clean race in Monaco &ndash; a grand prix that Horner described as &ldquo;the most confidence-requiring race&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>Confidence in the car and learning the quirks of the RB21 isn&rsquo;t the only cause for concern for Tsunoda, as incidents like his crash in Imola also hit Tsunoda&rsquo;s allocation of spares for the season.&nbsp;</p><p>The rebuild in Imola required a new survival cell and floor, which was a new spec that had only been added to Tsunoda&rsquo;s car a day before the crash. What&rsquo;s more, the rebuild warranted a raft of engine parts, including the internal combustion engine, turbocharger, MGU-H, MGU-K, energy store and control electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>Use of these parts is capped over a season, meaning that Tsunoda could find himself on the receiving end of a grid penalty further down the line. If those penalties start coming just as he gets to grip with his new team, the young racer may never realise the promise Red Bull held for him.&nbsp;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/tribal-and-toxic-social-media-sour-f1-fandom-but-what-can-be-done/10724924/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQRKOGY/s2/franco-colapinto-alpine-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Tribal and toxic social media sour F1 fandom, but what can be done?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 20 years later: Remembering the wildest Coke 600 in NASCAR history ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>When it comes to iconic NASCAR races, the 2005 running of NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 is up there as one of the wilded and most bizarre. It was May 29th, 2005, a few hours after Dan Wheldon had won his first Indianapolis 500 earlier in the day.</p><p>43 drivers took part in NASCAR's longest race and through 5+ hours of chaos, it came down to an aging champion searching for one last moment of glory and a new superstar on the cusp of greatness.</p><p>The race kicked off in the daylight with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/ryan-newman/384/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Newman</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jeff-gordon/24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Gordon</a> leading the field to the green flag. Seven laps were run before the caution flew and the safety vehicles were deployed in what would be a very busy night for them. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/martin-truex-jr/1975/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Truex Jr</a>. rubbed the wall and while it was nothing major, it was the beginning of the most caution-filled race in NASCAR history.</p><p id="test-123456">The first 100 laps were fairly subdued and nothing peculiar occurred. But as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-busch/17035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Busch</a> defended the lead against then-teammate Gordon, a multi-car pileup ensued on the backstretch. No big names collected, but the free pass did go to 2000 NASCAR Cup Series champion <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/bobby-labonte/30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobby Labonte</a>, who had started back in 34th. And you're going to want to remember that name for later.&nbsp;</p><h2>Chaos reigns</h2><p>Things began to unravel from that point onward. The race could hardly go 20 laps without an incident. Ten cautions flew between lap 115 and 240. Perhaps the most notable incident happened on the 247th lap, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/dale-earnhardt-jr/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> and then-teammate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/michael-waltrip/36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Waltrip</a> were battling for position. A misjudged crossover move by Earnhardt sent Waltrip spinning wildly down the frontstretch, destroying both cars in the process. Former Cup champions <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/matt-kenseth/29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Kenseth</a> and Terry Labonte also got swept up in the mess and had their nights ended prematurely. Terry's brother Bobby was able to weave through the chaos and just barely avoid the out-of-control race cars.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2GzXvZV0/s1000/dale-earnhardt-jr-dale-earnhar.jpg" alt="Dale Earnhardt Jr., Dale Earnhardt Inc. Chevrolet" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Dale Earnhardt Jr., Dale Earnhardt Inc. Chevrolet</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: George Tiedemann via Getty Images</p><p>When the race returned to green flag conditions, the carnage began to subside (for the moment) and everyone finally got the chance to take a breath after 375 miles of almost non-stop destruction. The cautions continued to trickle in, but they were for minor things such as a piece of debris or oil on the track. But when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kasey-kahne/1540/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kasey Kahne</a> blew a right front tire and threw debris all over the track, NASCAR was forced to display the yellow once more. How was this yellow more significant than the others? Well, it happened in the middle of green flag pit stops and just like that, the running order was turned upside down.</p><h2>The race-altering yellow</h2><p>All four Hendrick cars were trapped deep in the running order, as were many other top contenders. One driver was told to pit by his crew chief seconds before the caution was displayed, but that driver called an audible and decided to wait after seeing Kahne limping around on the apron. That driver would be veteran Bobby Labonte, who now ran second to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/carl-edwards/2306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Edwards</a>. With the rules as they were back then, cars that stayed out to get a lap back weren't waved around the pace car. Instead, they restarted just ahead of the leaders at the tail-end of the lead lap, putting Edwards and Labonte in the middle of the field -- and the eye of the storm.</p><p>On lap 364, Joe Nemehcek fought his way through the traffic and took over the race lead. With the drivers tired and the race running incredibly late, tempers began to flare. Under caution, Edwards and Dale Jarrett got into a shoving match with their cars over some earlier contact.</p><p>Another massive pileup took place with just twenty laps remaining. Seven cars in total received damage including notables such as Gordon, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/brian-vickers/2145/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Vickers</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kevin-harvick/360/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Harvick</a>, and Mark Martin. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jimmie-johnson/639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jimmie Johnson</a> was lucky to be directly in front of the accident as few behind it made it through. That wreck officially broke the old NASCAR record for cautions in a single Cup race, and they weren't even done tearing up equipment yet.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Yv87P1v0/s1000/brian-vickers-hendrick-motorsp.jpg" alt="Brian Vickers, Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet damage" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Brian Vickers, Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet damage</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Getty Images</p><p>As for Johnson, he had been quietly avoiding drama throughout the race. He entered the event as the favorite, and not just because the track was called Lowe's Motor Speedway at the time, which was also his primary sponsor. Johnson was the defending winner of the Coke 600 and swept both races at Charlotte the previous year. He was now one of the few drivers left standing in the closing laps.</p><p>And this race wasn't done surprising us just yet. As the laps ticked down to under ten laps remaining, race leader Nemechek lost control and backed it into the wall due to a tire failure. His mangled No. 01 machine slid down the track and directly into the path of Johnson. The No. 48 somehow made it through the blinding smoke, inches away from what would have been a terrible impact.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6l9rVEN0/s1000/joe-nemechek-crashes-from-the-.jpg" alt="Joe Nemechek crashes from the lead" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Joe Nemechek crashes from the lead</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Getty Images</p><p>The lead was put into the hands of none other than Bobby Labonte. That weekend was weird for him, even before the green flag flew. His bright green Interstate Batteries car was replaced with FedEx colors for this race because his teammate Jason Leffler, who had originally carried the scheme, failed to qualify for the event. The company then made an unusual deal with Gibbs to be placed on the No. 18 car. Labonte was also facing a winless streak that dated back to the end of the 2003 season and he was eager to return to Victory Lane.</p><h2>Labonte fights to the bitter end</h2><p>The race was red-flagged with nine laps to go and the commentators decided to speak with Labonte, but as they quickly found out, he wasn't in the mood for chatting.</p><p><em>"You got me Bobby?" ... "Yeah." ... "Do you think you can hold him off?"... "I'm gonna try." ... "How good is your car? As good as it's been all night I guess?" ... "Yeah."</em></p><p>He was so focused on the mission ahead of him, knowing he had the inferior car. But he was not about to bow down in the face of such odds. That weekend was also the tenth anniversary of Labonte's first win at the Cup level, which came at this same race in 1995. He knew that behind him, he had a hungry rookie in Edwards and Johnson's Hendrick-powered No. 48. Johnson also had slightly fresher tires than those ahead of him.</p><p>The race resumed with just six laps left. Johnson quickly moved forward, taking second with four laps and six miles left to run Labonte down. Well, he was on him in a single lap.&nbsp;</p><p>Labonte fought with everything he had, but he also had a reputation as one of the cleanest drivers in the field. He wasn't about to get physical in this tense battle for the win. Johnson sent it to the inside of Labonte in Turn 1 on the final lap, but he got too tight and had to lift. It looked as if the battle was over, but Johnson was not finished yet. He sent it deep into the final set of corners on the outside, sparks flying out from under his No. 48 Chevrolet. He clawed forward, pulling alongside Labonte out of Turn 4 as the stands erupted with camera flashes.</p><p>At the line, just 0.027s separated them in the closest finish in the entire 65-year history of the Coke 600. Johnson enjoyed the sweet taste of Victory Lane champagne that night, while Labonte endured the bitter agony of defeat, kicking the side of his car in disgust. It was not the celebration he had hoped for to commemorate his first NASCAR Cup win from ten years prior. And as fate would have it, Labonte raced on for another decade, and never won again.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"He did it!" Jimmie Johnson and Bobby Labonte put on a show in the 2005 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. <a href="https://t.co/t2j2mXmL3L">pic.twitter.com/t2j2mXmL3L</a></p>&mdash; FOX: NASCAR (@NASCARONFOX) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARONFOX/status/1397629106427101185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>The 46th running of the Coca Cola 600 was a riveting, but bizarre event that lasted five hours and 13 minutes. It featured a record number of cautions at 22, which has yet to be beat. 21 of the 43 drivers that started the race led at one point and the driver who led the most laps [Vickers] never even made it to the finish. And when the smoke cleared, only 36 inches stood between the first and second place cars. It signified the clashing of two eras with Labonte, one of the last stars of the Winston Cup era losing to the man who would turn the newly introduced NASCAR playoffs into his personal playground.</p><p>And while there have been plenty of weird and wild Coke 600s, nothing compares to what went on this Sunday evening in 2005.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/the-double-what-is-it-and-the-rare-group-kyle-larson-hopes-to-join/10724790/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YMdwONv2/s2/kyle-larson-arrow-mclaren.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">The Double: After 2024 failure, Kyle Larson hopes to finally join exclusive group</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/tim-cindric-executives-ousted-by-penske-indycar-rules-breach/10724946/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6zQKx7wY/s2/tim-cindric-team-penske-chevro.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Tim Cindric, two other executives ousted by Penske in rules breach fallout</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/2026-nascar-hall-of-fame-class-revealed/10724761/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YW78mROY/s2/kurt-busch-daytona-500-winner.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Kurt Busch among those selected for 2026 NASCAR Hall of Fame class</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascars-longest-race-to-feature-full-field-with-40-entries-for-the-coke-600/10724552/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/68yqo4D0/s2/coke-600-action.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">NASCAR's longest race to feature full field of 40 cars for the Coke 600</a><p><iframe style="display: none;" title="Twitter settings iframe" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.2f70fb173b9000da126c79afe2098f02.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-thewall.motorsport.com" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p><iframe id="rufous-sandbox" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: none; width: 0px; height: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;" title="Twitter analytics iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p><iframe style="display: none;" title="Twitter settings iframe" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.2f70fb173b9000da126c79afe2098f02.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-thewall.motorsport.com" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe id="rufous-sandbox" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: none; width: 0px; height: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;" title="Twitter analytics iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p><iframe style="display: none;" title="Twitter settings iframe" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.2f70fb173b9000da126c79afe2098f02.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-thewall.motorsport.com" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe id="rufous-sandbox" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: none; width: 0px; height: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;" title="Twitter analytics iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ The Double: After 2024 failure, Kyle Larson hopes to finally join exclusive group ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Attempting to complete 1,100 miles in a single day of racing is quite the challenge (unless you're an endurance racing driver), but it's even more daunting when you're doing it in two wildly different race cars and at two race tracks that are multiple states apart.</p><p>That is what it means when a driver like <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-larson/17135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Larson</a> says they are attempting 'The Double.' They start their day at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the Indy 500 around 12:45pm EST, and then end their day around 11pm EST at Charlotte Motor Speedway when NASCAR's longest race -- the Coca-Cola 600 -- reaches its conclusion.</p><p>Only four drivers have run both races on the same and only one -- three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Tony Stewart -- has actually managed to complete all 1,100 miles.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qX5grO6/s1000/kyle-larson-arrow-mclaren.jpg" alt="Kyle Larson, Arrow McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Kyle Larson, Arrow McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>Larson tried to join this group in 2024, but Mother Nature had other plans. Rain delayed the start of the Indy 500 and that same storm ended up following Larson to North Carolina, ending the Coke 600 before he could take over from Justin Allgaier mid-race.</p><p>Larson will have a second chance on Sunday, starting 19th in the Indy 500. Should he complete the Double, he will join John Andretti, Robby Gordon, Kurt Busch, and Stewart as the only drivers to have run both races on the same day. And if you're wondering how that went for them, then you have come to the right place.</p><h2>John Andretti -- The very first driver to accomplish 'The Double'</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/0/20000/28000/28600/28691/s1000/nascar-cup-talladega-2002-john-andretti.jpg" alt="John Andretti (Photo from early 2000s, not during 1994 'Double' attempt)" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">John Andretti (Photo from early 2000s, not during 1994 'Double' attempt)</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Richard Sloop</p><p>Before Andretti, several NASCAR drivers ventured to Indianapolis and simply chose to skip the Charlotte race. Some other 'Double' hopefuls failed to qualify or Mother Nature ruined their plans, too. So, it wasn't until 1994 when a driver finally managed to run both races on the same day, giving John the honor of being the very first.</p><p>He was a full-time NASCAR driver at the time, but he did have open-wheel experience and finished a solid tenth in the Indy 500. He made it to Charlotte just in time for the start, but was forced to begin the race from the rear of the field. He crashed early in the 600, but soldiered on until the car finally gave up after 220 of 400 laps.</p><h2>Robby Gordon -- The driver with more attempts than anyone else</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/1100000/1190000/1192000/1192400/1192450/s1000/indycar-indy-500-2004-robby-gordon.jpg" alt="Robby Gordon" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Robby Gordon</p><p>Robby made five runs at the Indy-Charlotte Double, which is more than any other driver. His first attempt came in 1997, but inclement weather pushed the Indy 500 to Monday and Tuesday. He tried again in 2000, but missed the start of the 600 due to weather. P.J. Jones started the event and got credit for the result, but Gordon did take over in the middle of the race.</p><p>His first successful attempt came in 2002, finishing eighth in the Indy 500 and 16th in the Coke 600. He finished one lap down at Charlotte, coming 1.5 miles shy of completing the full 1,100 miles of racing. He successfully ran the Double again in 2003, even though rain ended the 600 early. His final attempt came in 2004, but weather interfered once again. He had to leave mid-race in order to make the start of the 600.&nbsp;Jaques Lazier finished the 500 for Gordon, but since he started the race, he was credited with the result.</p><h2>Tony Stewart -- The only driver to complete every lap in both events</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/1100000/1170000/1174000/1174700/1174779/s1000/indycar-indianapolis-500-2001-tony-stewart.jpg" alt="Tony Stewart" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Tony Stewart</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: indyracing.com photo by Ron McQueeney</p><p>The most successful 'Double' attempt belongs to Stewart. He ran both events in 1999 and 2001. In his first attempt, Stewart finished ninth in the Indy 500 and fourth in the Coke 600. He was four laps down in the 500, which prevented him from completing all 1,100 miles.</p><p>2001 was the final time 'Smoke' ran the Indy 500, again aiming to finally complete all 1,100 miles between Indianapolis and Charlotte. Driving for <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/chip-ganassi-racing/52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chip Ganassi Racing</a> at Indianapolis, he finished sixth and then went on to finish third with Joe Gibbs Racing at Charlotte. It remains the best showing by any driver who has run these iconic races on the same day. In doing so, Stewart is the only driver to complete all 600 laps and 1,100 miles of competition.</p><h2>Kurt Busch -- The last driver to successfully run both races on the same day</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/1700000/1700000/1708000/1708200/1708246/s1000/indycar-indy-500-2014-kurt-busch-arrives-in-charlotte.jpg" alt="Kurt Busch arrives in Charlotte" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Kurt Busch arrives in Charlotte</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Walter G. Arce, Sr. KBI/ActionSportsInc.com</p><p>The Double hasn't been successfully done since 2014 with Kurt Busch came over from NASCAR. After a crash in practice, the <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/2026-nascar-hall-of-fame-class-revealed/10724761/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced NASCAR Hall of Famer</a> rebounded in a big way. He finished sixth in the Indy 500, earning Rookie of the Year honors. Unfortunately, the 600 did not go as well as a massive engine failure forced him out of the race after 271 of 400 laps.</p><p>Since then, several drivers have expressed interest in attempting the Double, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/kyle-busch-reveals-he-lost-indy-500-shot-with-mclaren-to-kyle-larson/10722461/" target="_self" rel="noopener">including Kurt's brother Kyle, who came close to securing rides in both the 2017 and 2024 Indy 500s.</a> Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jimmie-johnson/639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jimmie Johnson</a> ran the 2022 Indy 500 but he did not attempt the 2022 Coke 600.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Franco Colapinto’s dramatic Imola GP crash shouldn't define his Alpine F1 debut ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Any driver's weekend will always be defined by a heavy smash, and this is amplified if the driver in question is <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/franco-colapinto/875899/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franco Colapinto</a>, who made a high-profile 2025 debut with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> after replacing <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jack-doohan/454760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a> just six races into the Formula 1 season.</p><p>The Argentine was on his last lap at the end of Q1 when he drove onto the grass at the exit of the second turn at Tamburello. This sent him <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/massive-franco-colapinto-crash-red-flags-f1-imola-gp-qualifying-again/10723724/" target="_self" rel="noopener">spinning into the gravel trap and into the barriers</a>.</p><p>A crash was the last thing Colapinto needed, following the heavy shunts he sustained during the second part of his nine-race stint with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/williams/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams</a> last year in Brazil and Las Vegas. Even the acting Alpine boss, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/flavio-briatore-alpine-franco-colapinto/10723331/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Flavio Briatore, made this clear</a> on Friday at Imola.</p><p>&ldquo;He needs to be fast, not crash and score points,&rdquo; Briatore said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only asking him to do three things, not 10. If he does them well, he&rsquo;ll drive forever.&rdquo;</p><p>It's fair to argue Colapinto failed to deliver on at least one of those requests by crashing last Saturday, but a broader view of the Argentinian driver's weekend does show some encouraging signs as well.</p><p>All eyes were on <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-franco-colapinto-can-cement-his-alpine-f1-seat-to-become-pierre-gaslys-permanent-team-mate/10722801/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Colapinto when he returned to the paddock</a> on Thursday, this time as an Alpine racing driver. At the start of his first F1 stint with Williams, expectations were limited. Although his popularity quickly exploded in his home country, as he is the first Argentinian driver to race in F1 for more than two decades.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2QzA3BmY/s1000/franco-colapinto-alpine.jpg" alt="Franco Colapinto, Alpine" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Franco Colapinto, Alpine</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>This time, his loyal Argentinian fans started making noise early in the weekend and showed up at the racetrack on Thursday eager to witness their driver's return. While many observers felt it was <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-franco-colapinto-jack-doohan-f1-switch-official/10720453/" target="_self" rel="noopener">harsh for Alpine to replace Doohan</a> after just six races of the season, it was now on Colapinto to make the seat his and prove that he could achieve what the Australian couldn't. So, did he?</p><h2>Getting closer to Gasly</h2><p>After helping the team with the simulator in Enstone over recent races, and embarking on a series of testing of previous cars (TPC) events, Colapinto spent Friday's practice sessions getting to grips with driving the Alpine A525 for the first time in real life.</p><p>The Argentinian finished practice one in 17th place, 0.677 seconds behind his team-mate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/pierre-gasly/19626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pierre Gasly</a>, having been unable to maximise the potential of the soft tyre in his only attempt of the session. Nevertheless, Colapinto reduced this gap to less than half a second by the end of the second practice session, achieving 13th place, while Gasly was an impressive third on what <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/gasly-hails-best-friday-despite-imola-crash-with-rabbit-damaging-floor/10723427/" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Frenchman called the team's best Friday</a> of the year.</p><p>Having completed 50 laps on day one, Colapinto continued to improve during Saturday&rsquo;s third and final practice session ahead of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, descending to 18th fastest in the charts but finishing just three places and two tenths behind Gasly.</p><p>The gap between the two Alpine drivers remained consistent in Q1, with Colapinto setting a lap time of 1m16.256s on his first attempt. This put him in contention for a spot in Q2, just three tenths behind Gasly.</p><p>The crash that occurred in the final seconds of Q1 undermined the Argentinian's weekend. In his defence however, he wasn&rsquo;t the only driver to make a mistake.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/gabriel-bortoleto/950450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriel Bortoleto</a> lost control of his <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/sauber/9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sauber</a> and hit the barriers at the end of FP1; both <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/racing-bulls-12/12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racing Bulls</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/isack-hadjar/827922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isack Hadjar</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/liam-lawson/451769/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Lawson</a>, went off in almost the same place as Colapinto, with different consequences; and Red Bull's <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/828523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuki Tsunoda</a>, a driver on the brink of reaching 100 grand prix starts, crashed heavily in Q1.</p><p>&ldquo;It was probably the first time that I really reached the limit of the car," Colapinto explained as he took responsibility for the accident that left the front of his Alpine damaged.</p><p>"I was always a bit below, and it's easy to go beyond that limit. I was pushing the limits a bit more. The margins are very tight in qualifying nowadays, so I try to use the kerbs a bit more.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks really bad. But it's not as bad as it looks in terms of how I've adapted to the car. I'm much happier and more comfortable in the seat than I was yesterday.&rdquo;</p><h2>Good tyre management provides optimism</h2><p>The one-place penalty that Colapinto incurred due to a miscommunication with the team regarding when to leave the garage after Tsunoda&rsquo;s accident didn&rsquo;t help in Sunday's race, nor did the couple of places he lost in the opening lap.</p><p>However, given the track characteristics and his lack of experience with the car, a big recovery was never a realistic target for Colapinto. Nevertheless, he still managed to showcase solid tyre management in the first stint, when the car is heavier with fuel, and that is often a weakness for rookies.</p><p>He was one of the last drivers to get rid of the medium Pirelli tyres when he pitted on lap 22, something he could have capitalised on if it hadn't been for the poorly timed VSC. Nevertheless, in the latter stages of the race, he was able to match Gasly's pace and even set a faster lap time than his team-mate, albeit with tyres half the age of the Frenchman's.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6VRzM346/s1000/franco-colapinto-alpine.jpg" alt="Franco Colapinto, Alpine" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Franco Colapinto, Alpine</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>The end result was an unspectacular 16th place in Imola for Colapinto, who didn&rsquo;t fulfil all of Briatore&rsquo;s expectations, but neither did his teammate following the mistake that cost Gasly the opportunity to score points.</p><p>"It was actually a positive day after qualifying," he said. "The race was a bit against us. I did the longest stint on the medium tyre, I was going for a one-stop, we changed the strategy quite a bit and I had very good pace compared to when we were on the hard tyres. When we stopped to put on the hard tyres a couple of laps later, the VSC came and killed me.</p><p>"The most important thing is that we had the pace and that compared to those around us, we were very strong. After that, we have to work to keep learning and understanding the car a little more.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we have good data to go into the next races with a little more learning and a little more comfortable with the car."&nbsp;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/massive-franco-colapinto-crash-red-flags-f1-imola-gp-qualifying-again/10723724/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/2QzA3BmY/s2/franco-colapinto-alpine.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Massive Franco Colapinto crash red-flags F1 Imola GP qualifying again</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/flavio-briatore-alpine-franco-colapinto/10723331/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6b7d1Rr0/s2/franco-colapinto-alpine-talks-.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Flavio Briatore denies Alpine&rsquo;s five-race F1 plan for Franco Colapinto</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/arrow-mclaren/56/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arrow McLaren</a> team principal <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/tony-kanaan/510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Kanaan</a> said his team is &ldquo;not doing anything different&rdquo; in its approach to this year's 109th running of the Indianapolis 500, despite its driver Pato O&rsquo;Ward losing out to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/team-penske/50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Penske</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Newgarden</a> in the closing stages of the 2024 race.</p><p>Kanaan, who won <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/" target="_self" rel="noopener">the 500</a> in 2013, will lead McLaren&rsquo;s four-car lineup at this year&rsquo;s race, with O&rsquo;Ward lining up alongside <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nolan-siegel/952776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolan Siegel</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/christian-lundgaard/444724/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Lundgaard</a>, and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-larson/17135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Larson</a>. The team is chasing an ultimate victory at the Brickyard, and Kanaan says he speaks from experience when it comes to the team&rsquo;s approach to winning the historic race.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the way I took it throughout my career was, every time that I came to this race, I had to put myself in a position to win,&rdquo; Kanaan said. &ldquo;And first is by participating, it&rsquo;s number one. And then working towards your goal.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pinpoint one thing why we lost the race with two corners to go. I can only look ahead and say, &lsquo;alright, let&rsquo;s look at what we think we need to improve, how we can play the race strategy-wise,&rsquo; and we&rsquo;ll see if we&rsquo;re there at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to be careful how you approach it, and you [can&rsquo;t] let it get into your head. It can make you immortal, a forever-winner. But it can also destroy you.</p><p>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re approaching with the same approach: we respect the racetrack, we have fast race cars, and we&rsquo;re going to leave it all out there.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked what he&rsquo;ll be doing on his side to help O&rsquo;Ward, Kanaan added that he would &ldquo;do everything I can.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2y3G7Zn6/s1000/pato-o-ward-arrow-mclaren-chev.jpg" alt="Pato O'Ward, Arrow McLaren Chevrolet" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Pato O'Ward, Arrow McLaren Chevrolet</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Josh Tons / Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;I told Pato, &lsquo;if I could drive the car&rsquo;, but I think I&rsquo;m worse than him, so he&rsquo;s the best guy on the wheel,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;And then within the whole team and Pato, [we have] the tools and the mindset, and everything to win a race, which is kind of a big responsibility on my end. As a race car driver, I had my crew only to worry about.</p><p>&ldquo;We have four cars in the race, four chances. I&rsquo;m not putting all my coins on Pato, but he was the one that has the good record here.&rdquo;</p><p>But Kanaan is hesitant to think too much about what an Indy 500 win would mean to him and the team, adding that he will try not to think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;I think over the years, I&rsquo;ve learned that this kind of expectation can really destroy you,&rdquo; Kanaan said. &ldquo;You know when you, like, think about how you&rsquo;re going to celebrate, and that anticipation? I&rsquo;ve never liked that, because I think it needs to be natural.</p><p>&ldquo;But it would mean a lot to the team, right? McLaren has a history. We are a race team, our team this year has never stopped racing. Look how much we&rsquo;re dominating in Formula 1.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, this team grew, so it was a race team that became this empire.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6VRzVrv6/s1000/christian-lundgaard-arrow-mcla.jpg" alt="Christian Lundgaard, Arrow McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Christian Lundgaard, Arrow McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>Ahead of the Indy 500, Arrow McLaren has two drivers in the top five of IndyCar's standings, with Lundgaard third with 150 points, just one point behind <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-kirkwood/290499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Kirkwood</a> in second, and O&rsquo;Ward following with 148. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/chip-ganassi-racing/52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chip Ganassi Racing</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/alex-palou/21151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Palou</a> is dominating so far, however, and leads Kirkwood by 97 points.</p><p>While facing the gulf to Palou up front, Kanaan is realistic about his team&rsquo;s goals as he looks ahead to the rest of the 2025 IndyCar season.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to keep it the same,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing has to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the ups-and-downs, or a bad result, or a good result, could not change the focus and the goal.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we have a hard task on Palou, that has been extremely strong. I mean, his worst finish has been second. So, we&rsquo;ve got to capitalise on it and keep it as close as we can.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t second-guess each other. We have a plan. If it&rsquo;s going to be enough or not, I will be able to answer you in a few months when the season is over. But this is by no means an excuse. I got in this year, I&rsquo;m committed, I&rsquo;m a racer, I&rsquo;ve been a race car driver my entire career.</p><p>&ldquo;People say, &lsquo;do you love winning races?&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;actually it&rsquo;s the opposite.

<![CDATA[ <p>Ex-Formula 1 driver <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/daniil-kvyat/15918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniil Kvyat</a> believes Red Bull still has a &ldquo;very quick car&rdquo; that can take the fight to championship leaders <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> despite the early deficit.</p><p>The Austrian squad is third in the standings, 148 points behind the leaders with only two victories compared to McLaren&rsquo;s five.&nbsp;</p><p>In many grands prix Red Bull has simply struggled to match McLaren&rsquo;s pace as, in Bahrain for example, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> aboard the leading RB21 was 34.3 seconds off winner <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.</p><p>But Kvyat is still confident that Red Bull can fight for the championship, believing &ldquo;they are not far from McLaren when they put the car in the working window&rdquo;. The main issue has simply been that the car is too &ldquo;peaky&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;To be in that sweet spot, it's very narrow,&rdquo; Kvyat added, while speaking to the F1 Nation podcast after the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.</p><p>&ldquo;You always try to maximise the car's potential while building it and then let engineers and drivers deal with it to do a good job with set-up and driving.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeO9mB2/s1000/63-lamborghini-iron-lynx-lambo.jpg" alt="#63 Lamborghini Iron Lynx Lamborghini SC63: Daniil Kvyat" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">#63 Lamborghini Iron Lynx Lamborghini SC63: Daniil Kvyat</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Nikolaz Godet</p><p>&ldquo;But if you slide slightly away from this window, let's say, then the consequences are also huge and you lose a lot of lap time.&rdquo;</p><p>Kvyat thinks that Red Bull &ldquo;not having as much to lose&rdquo; could actually boost it in the 2025 constructors&rsquo; championship with McLaren not really familiar with such dominance.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The pole difference [in Imola] was only half a tenth and also in the race where the deg is low, I feel like Red Bull can definitely be there with McLaren and especially if McLaren is behind them,&rdquo; said Kvyat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It's not going to be easy and of course also having not much to lose can fight a bit harder with the elbows out.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Chris Lulham on learning from Max Verstappen's secret Nurburgring test ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Last week, someone named <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-franz-hermann-max-verstappen-shares-details-of-nurburgring-gt3-test/10722961/" target="_self" rel="noopener">"Franz Hermann" drew significant attention during a GT3 test</a> at the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Behind this alias was none other than four-time Formula 1 champion <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a>, who got behind the wheel of the Ferrari 296 GT3 from Swiss outfit Emil Frey Racing during an <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/max-verstappen-sets-sights-on-nordschleife-permit-after-gt3-testing/10721701/" target="_self" rel="noopener">official Nurburgring Endurance Series test</a>.</p><p>The Red Bull F1 driver collaborates with Emil Frey Racing under the Verstappen.com Racing banner and wanted to get some laps in on the "Green Hell" without attracting crowds of fans to the pit lane in the early morning.</p><p>He succeeded in keeping things quiet, but that also meant many quickly forgot that <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/max-verstappen-goes-undercover-to-take-part-in-ferrari-gt3-test/10721550/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Verstappen wasn&rsquo;t the only one in the car that day</a>. Chris Lulham, sim racer for Team Redline &ndash; Verstappen&rsquo;s sim racing team &ndash; was also present.</p><p>He appeared in some photos, though remained anonymous throughout the ordeal. &ldquo;We shared the car all day,&rdquo; Lulham said in an interview with Motorsport.com at the GT World Challenge event in Zandvoort.</p><p>&ldquo;I mainly drove in the afternoon &ndash; I think I did most of the laps then. It was an incredible experience driving that track for the first time. Nothing can really prepare you for it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done thousands of laps on the simulator and even won the 24-hour sim race there several times, but nothing compares to the real thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Lulham has been competing with Team Redline for several years now, and not without success. The Brit has made a name for himself by winning major sim racing events, which this year earned him a seat in GT3 racing with Verstappen.com Racing.</p><p>Though he has some prior experience in karting and motorsport, sim racing was his path to the real racing world.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a strange experience,&rdquo; Lulham said about his Nurburgring test. &ldquo;In the afternoon, more people started showing up. I don&rsquo;t think many of them even realized I was in the car too&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/33-cl-re2-6742.jpg" alt="Chris Lulham will make his debut in GT3 racing this year for Verstappen.com Racing." width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Chris Lulham will make his debut in GT3 racing this year for Verstappen.com Racing.</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: SRO</p><p>When it&rsquo;s pointed out that he was indeed visible in some of the photos, but the focus was mainly on "Franz," Lulham laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But he was super helpful throughout the day. We had the live onboard feed in the truck, and he pointed out the little lines he had discovered.</p><p>&ldquo;There are over a hundred corners on that track, so plenty of nuances to find. We helped each other with what we learned. It was a very productive day and the car was really fast.&rdquo;</p><p>While Verstappen&rsquo;s participation attracted most of the attention, the underlying purpose of the test was also a topic of discussion. According to Lulham, both drivers had a similar objective: to log miles on the Nordschleife and support the team.</p><p>&ldquo;It was the first time on the Nordschleife for both of us. And also about building a baseline for the team, as it was the first time the 296 had been run on that track,&rdquo; Lulham explained.</p><p>&ldquo;We both need to get a permit if we want to race there. That&rsquo;s still an open question.&rdquo;</p><p>Lulham confirmed that he does aspire to race in the 24 Hours of the Nurburgring. To do that, drivers must go through a permit process. Those aiming to compete in powerful cars like GT3s or Porsche Cups must obtain permit A, which requires drivers to first attend a kind of &lsquo;school&rsquo; covering the rules. Next, they must accumulate track time and participate in at least two races of the Nurburgring Langstrecken-Serie (NLS) in slower race cars.</p><p>Lulham knows he needs to follow that path to make his dream a reality, which means doing those races in slower machinery. There&rsquo;s no guarantee he&rsquo;ll earn the permit this year, though.</p><p>&ldquo;There are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up to make that happen,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to get that permit in the coming months if I want to race. For Max, it&rsquo;s a different story. He obviously has very limited time. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what his plans are. Hopefully, we can both race in the NLS by the end of the year.&rdquo;</p><h2>Crucial Support</h2><p>Lulham spent several years karting and was even runner-up in the OKJ Karting Championship in 2017. Since then, he&rsquo;s raced in Formula 4 and the Radical Cup Championship, but thanks to support from Verstappen.com Racing, he&rsquo;s now competing at the highest level of GT3 racing &ndash; the GT World Challenge Europe &ndash; in both sprint and endurance races.</p><p>Support from Verstappen.com Racing and Verstappen himself has &ldquo;been crucial&rdquo; to this rise through he ranks, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;We had a long winter program that started late last year to prepare me for this season, and I think the results show that,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;To get into the Ferrari for the first race and immediately qualify on the front row, just two hundredths off pole&hellip; That shows what&rsquo;s possible with the right preparation and the right people behind you.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQRMj1Y/s1000/69-emil-frey-racing-ferrari-29.jpg" alt="#69 Emil Frey Racing, Ferrari 296 GT3: Thierry Vermeulen, Chris Lulham" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="photographer">Foto door: SRO</p><p>Lulham was surprised that he was immediately quick and able to run at the front. During the winter program, he could already track his progress, supported by reference points from team-mate Thierry Vermeulen &ndash; son of Max&rsquo;s manager Raymond Vermeulen &ndash; and Verstappen himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I could see my own improvements, so I already knew what I was capable of going into the first races,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;But being aware of it is one thing &ndash; executing under pressure in a race weekend, with limited laps, is another. You&rsquo;re thrown straight into qualifying, and that might be your first run on a new set of tires. You have to maximize what you&rsquo;ve got in that moment. Did I expect it? I expected I was capable, but to actually pull it off immediately? Probably not.&rdquo;</p><p>The adventure with Verstappen.com Racing is still in its early stages, but Lulham is very satisfied with the support so far.</p><p>&ldquo;The Verstappen.com Racing family is a big one, with many influential people backing me and my career,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;You always feel the support, but you also feel the pressure &ndash; so it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword. But it&rsquo;s been a fantastic start.&rdquo;</p><h2>Very Similar</h2><p>Lulham was surprised by some aspects of transitioning from sim racing to real-world motorsport. Not so much the driving itself, but more the level of aggression on track compared to sim races.</p><p>&ldquo;I expected it to be aggressive, but this level&hellip; Of course, you&rsquo;re racing at the top of international GT competition, so everyone is here to win, fighting for every position.&rdquo;</p><p>He also had to adapt to the many variables in real-world racing.</p><p>&ldquo;In the simulator, you don&rsquo;t deal with so many variables affecting every moment of the race,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably the biggest thing I had to adjust to. Then there&rsquo;s the physical side, whereas I was very mentally trained for the sim. I&rsquo;d say the mental aspects are very similar, as are the techniques used. That&rsquo;s probably why I could jump in with so much confidence.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yqejl0/s1000/69-emil-frey-racing-ferrari-29.jpg" alt="#69 Emil Frey Racing, Ferrari 296 GT3: Thierry Vermeulen, Chris Lulham" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="photographer">Foto door: SRO</p><p>One thing sim racing can&rsquo;t really teach, according to Lulham, is wheel-to-wheel racing.</p><p>&ldquo;You understand the technique behind it, but actually doing it &ndash; putting your body and the car on the line &ndash; that&rsquo;s a whole different story,&rdquo; Lulham added.&nbsp;</p><p>Sim racers are often accused of making reckless moves they wouldn&rsquo;t dare attempt in real life, knowing the real-world consequences. Still, Lulham thinks GT3 racing has surprised him in this area.</p><p>&ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;d say that the professional level of sim racing is cleaner than the professional level in the real world,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d expect the opposite, with all the money involved, but that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s become a trend for sim racers to make the leap to real motorsport &ndash; and often, they perform well. But does real-world experience feed back into his sim racing?</p><p>&ldquo;It helps in the sense that you work with skilled engineers during real race weekends &ndash; people who&rsquo;ve been in the sport for years,&rdquo; Lulham said.</p><p>&ldquo;You learn lots of small details you might miss as a sim racer, and you start thinking differently. In terms of lap time, it probably doesn&rsquo;t help, because the techniques you use in a real car differ. But I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;ll still be competitive in sim races this year.&rdquo;</p><h2>Very Helpful</h2><p>In the GT World Challenge, Lulham is teamed up with Vermeulen, who has built solid GT3 experience in DTM and GTWC in recent years. They haven&rsquo;t done many races together yet, but Lulham is happy with the partnership so far.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very helpful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With his years of experience in a GT3 car, he can point out things I wouldn&rsquo;t have even thought about. In pre-season, there are so many little things &ndash; how the Pirelli tires work, how to warm them up, which curbs to use or avoid, which lines to take.</p><p>&ldquo;At first, I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of some of these, but someone like Thierry sees them and helps me. He&rsquo;s really guided me well over the past few months toward becoming a professional driver.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/69-0q3a1478.jpg" alt="Chris Lulham enjoys working with Thierry Vermeulen." width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Chris Lulham enjoys working with Thierry Vermeulen.</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: SRO</p><p>In a GT class where the car is shared, it&rsquo;s also a big advantage if both drivers are evenly matched and, so far, this is going well for Lulham.</p><p>&ldquo;During pre-season, we were always very close. Sometimes I was faster, sometimes he was. But the gaps were always small,&rdquo; the Briton said.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been the case in every race, like the endurance race at Paul Ricard and the sprint at Brands Hatch. You can&rsquo;t really prepare for experiences like your first races and race starts. So it&rsquo;s great to have someone like Thierry by your side.&rdquo;</p><p>Together with Vermeulen, Lulham wants to make a big impression in the Gold Cup class of the GT World Challenge. The rookie even believes a top-three finish overall is possible. The pair is currently in 10th, but at Brands Hatch &ndash; where they won the Gold Cup &ndash; an outright victory didn&rsquo;t seem far off.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-franz-hermann-max-verstappen-shares-details-of-nurburgring-gt3-test/10722961/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0mbBbGG2/s2/max-verstappen-emil-fray-racin-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Who is Franz Hermann?

Every race has its own challenges, and we&rsquo;ll have highs and lows &ndash; we already have. Long-term, we&rsquo;re still early in my first season, so I don&rsquo;t know where this journey will go yet. I can&rsquo;t say anything for certain, but I&rsquo;d love to make a career out of this.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The start of the 2025 IndyCar Series season has been a very promising one for new <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/arrow-mclaren/56/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arrow McLaren</a> star <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/christian-lundgaard/444724/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Lundgaard</a>.</p><p>Having claimed three podiums in the opening five rounds, he is third in the championship and sits just one point behind <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-kirkwood/290499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Kirkwood</a> while <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/alex-palou/21151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Palou</a> is the runaway leader.&nbsp;</p><p>Such form has led to Lundgaard labelling it as a &ldquo;rocket start to the season&rdquo;, with the fourth-year IndyCar driver now confident of contending for a maiden crown in 2025 despite a 98-point gap to Palou.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The amount of points the #10 car [Palou] has accumulated already, they can lose them as fast as they&rsquo;ve gained them,&rdquo; the 23-year-old Dane told Motorsport.com.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to have bad weekends. They can&rsquo;t win every weekend. I know that&rsquo;s what it looks like right now. But at the end of the day, we need to focus on what we can control.</p><p>&ldquo;After that, I&rsquo;m pretty confident that we can be in the mix at the end of the year, and that&rsquo;s all we can hope for.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/63vbWEqY/s1000/alex-palou-chip-ganassi-racing.jpg" alt="Alex Palou, Chip Ganassi Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Alex Palou, Chip Ganassi Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s trying not to get caught up in what the #10 car is doing, because at the end of the day, we need to run our own races, our own season.</p><p>&ldquo;Once we get to the end of the season, we&rsquo;ll see who we&rsquo;re fighting. But I definitely always think that there&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>Lundgaard even revealed his surprise at having such a start to the year, saying: &ldquo;If you would have told me six months ago that that was the case, I don&rsquo;t think any of us would really have believed it.</p><p>&ldquo;We were never really expecting this, obviously we were hoping for it. I don&rsquo;t think it was ever really an expectation.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just nice. Coming from where I&rsquo;ve been the past three years, it&rsquo;s been a struggle more often than not.</p><p>&ldquo;And I think now, I&rsquo;m very much at peace, just enjoying driving, and I think you&rsquo;re seeing that from the results as well. It just feels so nice to finally feel like you get rewarded for the work that&rsquo;s been put in.&rdquo;</p><p>Before making the move to Arrow McLaren for 2025, Lundgaard spent three full seasons at <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/rahal-letterman-lanigan-racing/51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing</a>, achieving three podium finishes including a win at Toronto in 2023. So, just five races into his Arrow McLaren stint, he has already equalled his previous podium count.</p><p>&ldquo;The first couple of weeks, times in the car, it was a little bit of a - not necessarily a struggle - it was just very different, and it was something to get used to with the car,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;The first, I&rsquo;d say, two-and-a-half weeks, weekends, we were in the car, it was one clear direction. We need to solve this problem for me to feel much more comfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;When you have a muscle memory and you suddenly are being thrown into something different, you have to kind of adjust to that, and I&rsquo;m now at a point where I&rsquo;m at peace, and I&rsquo;m comfortable with the material and how the car handles, and it&rsquo;s more to my liking.&rdquo;</p><p>Lundgaard also spoke about his relationship with team-mate Pato O&rsquo;Ward, and how it has been for him adjusting to a new environment.</p><p>&ldquo;My personal honest opinion has really been: going into the season, you&rsquo;re coming into a team that is kind of known as &lsquo;Pato&rsquo;s team&rsquo;, right?,&rdquo; he said.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6b7dvwj0/s1000/patricio-o-ward-arrow-mclaren.jpg" alt="Patricio O'ward, Arrow McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Patricio O'ward, Arrow McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>&ldquo;Pato and I have had that conversation prior to even joining the team. Not everybody knew at the time, we had a short little conversation about it, and we&rsquo;re both very much in the same kind of eye-level of, &lsquo;hey, we know we&rsquo;re both fast. Let&rsquo;s not just fight each other, but let&rsquo;s try to bring the team forward and make these cars as fast as we can&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I think already at this point we&rsquo;ve seen that.&rdquo;</p><p>Lundgaard explained that if &ldquo;we make a mistake on the #7 car, the #5 car picks up the pieces&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just proven to be a very strong pairing,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Because, we can fight, one weekend I&rsquo;m faster, one weekend he&rsquo;s faster, and we&rsquo;re pushing each other in that sense.&rdquo;</p><p>He also spoke about his relationship with his other team-mate, 20-year-old <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nolan-siegel/952776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolan Siegel</a>, who stepped full-time into the #6 car at the ninth round of the 2024 season, the Firestone Grand Prix.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Nolan is learning a lot from us in that sense, and I think Nolan has a tremendous amount of potential,&rdquo; Lundgaard said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be a very, very fast competitive driver in the future.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s young, he&rsquo;s still 20-years-old. He can&rsquo;t buy a beer in the States yet! One day, he will be there, and he will be as competitive and as strong as we are at the moment, and he will definitely be one to look out for.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0rGXVOd2/s1000/nolan-siegel-arrow-mclaren.jpg" alt="Nolan Siegel, Arrow McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Nolan Siegel, Arrow McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>In the lead-up to this weekend&rsquo;s Indianapolis 500, Lundgaard explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calm right now. I think that the weekend is going to bring what it&rsquo;s going to bring, and I think that&rsquo;s ultimately just my approach to it.</p><p>&ldquo;I changed my perspective completely after the [Indy] GP to just be: &lsquo;hey, just go out and have fun, go out and enjoy, take it all in, learn as much as you can&rsquo;, and the result will be what it will be.</p><p>&ldquo;The McLaren cars have been strong at the Indy 500, so now I need to go out and deliver with that.&rdquo;</p><p>He also spoke about the future with the Arrow McLaren team, saying: &ldquo;They believed in what I was capable of doing and I think already we&rsquo;ve kind of proven to both of us, to ourselves, to each other, that it was the right decision.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to see weekends where we&rsquo;re, to say it straight out loud, going to shit the bed!</p><p>&ldquo;I think from an overall consistency standpoint, I think we&rsquo;ll be there every weekend. I think their approach and their mentality in the #7 car has been very straightforward.</p><p>&ldquo;Simplicity is key, and don&rsquo;t really let anything affect us. Just go with the flow. And it&rsquo;s helped us so far, right? And I don&rsquo;t see it changing in the near future.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Tribal and toxic social media sour F1 fandom, but what can be done? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dozens of fans were chanting his name at Imola as their favourite Formula 1 driver climbed the pitwall after the race to greet them. But this was not a <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/ferrari/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferrari</a> driver celebrating, let's say, a podium on home soil. Instead, it was Alpine's <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/franco-colapinto/875899/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franco Colapinto</a>, who had come home in 16th place after a muted first grand prix upon his F1 return last weekend.</p><p>The attention surrounding Colapinto beggars belief. The 21-year-old appeared on the scene last year from close to nowhere, being handed Logan Sargeant's <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/williams/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams</a> seat in Monza after impressing team boss James Vowles through his reserve driver duties and an FP1 outing at Silverstone.</p><p>Little could have prepared Williams for the increased interest and scrutiny as Argentina yearned for its next sporting hero, 23 years after its last representative on the F1 grid. TV ratings in the region shot up, as did the masses of Argentinian fans travelling to any race they could. But, with the swell of interest, came a much more sinister undercurrent of tribalism and abuse, which has been pervading the series ever since its mainstream success through Netflix hit <em>Drive to Survive</em>, which just collected its second Sports Emmy Award.</p><h2>Football fan behaviour is about the last sport F1 fans should take clues from</h2><p>The us-versus-them attitude inextricably linked with football and select other sports has increasingly seeped into F1 as the championship attracts a much wider and less knowledgeable audience, coinciding with the advent of social media.</p><p>The bitter 2021 title fight between <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> devolved in a toxic mess online, from subsets of fans on both sides, and it triggered abuse against third parties including FIA race director Michael Masi and Williams driver <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nicholas-latifi/19443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas Latifi</a>, whose Abu Dhabi crash was the catalyst for a dramatic turn of events that ended with Verstappen claiming a controversial title. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/racing-bulls-12/12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racing Bulls</a> man <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/liam-lawson/451769/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Lawson</a> also faced abuse after clashing with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/sergio-perez/9328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Perez</a> at last year's Mexican Grand Prix while effectively vying for the Mexican's Red Bull seat.</p><p>As Colapinto made his return as an <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> reserve driver this year, a part of his growing fanbase took to social media to harass and pressurise <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jack-doohan/454760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a>, Colapinto's direct rival for the seat.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YXREmwN0/s1000/jack-doohan-alpine.jpg" alt="Abuse started to be directed at Doohan as soon as Colapinto entered the Alpine picture" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Abuse started to be directed at Doohan as soon as Colapinto entered the Alpine picture</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>The matter came to a head at last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix; the first in which Colapinto replaced Doohan as an Alpine racer. A parody account fabricated an Instagram story by Doohan's father alleging to make fun of Colapinto's qualifying crash, which was reported as genuine by Argentinian media and led to a further torrent of abuse. Tsunoda also landed in the crosshairs of Argentinian accounts after he and Colapinto were involved in a common and innocuous impeding incident in Friday practice at Imola, with the Red Bull driver abused for gesticulating towards Colapinto.</p><p>It's important to stress we are talking about a vocal minority, and that numerous Argentinian fans also responded to Tsunoda's Instagram posts with messages of support for the Japanese driver, apologising for the behaviour of others. And the above mentioned examples also show it's not just an Argentinian problem, nor is it just a motorsport problem.</p><p>But, while generalising is not helpful, it would be wrong to ignore the elephant in the room. Subsets of Argentinian fans are embracing a sporting culture that has normalised vitriol and violence much more than other countries. A Copa Libertadores final - South America's equivalent to the UEFA Champions League - between the country's two football giants Boca Juniors and River Plate had to be postponed in 2018 after Boca's team bus was attacked en route to the stadium, leaving several players with injuries, the latest example of a history of violence and abuse surrounding arguably football's biggest rivalry. The second leg of the final was eventually played in Madrid for safety reasons.</p><p>It is an unfortunate by-product of a proud and patriotic fandom culture that has also been transplanted into other sports. When touring car ace Agustin Canapino headed to IndyCar in 2023 to race for the partly Argentinian-owned Juncos Hollinger Racing squad, his team-mate Callum Ilott was the target of abuse on several occasions. In 2024 McLaren's Theo Pourchaire <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/indycar-teams-condemn-pourchaire-death-threats-for-canapino-detroit-clash/10619489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also reported receiving death threats</a>&nbsp;after contact with the Argentinian at the Detroit Grand Prix.</p><p>As a result, Canapino left the series and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/arrow-mclaren-terminates-juncos-alliance-social-media-controversy/10620145/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren called off its alliance with Juncos</a>, with the problematic part of his fans actually undermining its hero's career rather than boosting it. Those who have abused Doohan, Tsunoda and others in the name of supporting Colapinto would do well to remember that. Colapinto himself has also called on his supporters to "give respect" to his competitors.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Yv8qar70/s1000/agustin-canapino-juncos-hollin.jpg" alt="Canapino losing his IndyCar drive shows how abuse fans can hinder the drivers they idolise" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Canapino losing his IndyCar drive shows how abuse fans can hinder the drivers they idolise</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Josh Tons / Motorsport Images</p><h2>What can actually be done by the motorsport community?</h2><p>The problem F1 and other sports are facing is obviously a product of its time. Can you imagine social media existing in the days of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost?</p><p>But quite how the wider online toxicity problem can be tackled is a different matter. With good intentions, the motorsport community has already taken steps to curb abuse. In 2023 the FIA established the United Against Online Abuse (UAOA) campaign, working with sporting organisations, governments and tech companies to chart online abuse and then find solutions to tackle the issue. FOM itself and its teams have also undertaken work to stamp out abuse, with their digital teams working diligently to block inappropriate content.</p><p>As social media has become a staple of how people consume news and information, a part of the responsibility also lies with legacy news organisations. Some companies intentionally publish 'ragebait' and even organisations with the best intentions will often struggle to provide enough context and nuance on social media, where time, space and attention spans are in short supply.</p><p>The fake post attributed to Mick Doohan, which was published by an account known for parody and satire, was spread and taken at face value by Argentina's TV rightsholder on which many domestic fans are relying to understand the sport, especially newer followers who recently boarded the Colapinto hype train. The broadcaster has since apologised, but the damage was already done.</p><p>Perhaps all media companies can learn lessons from the events over the Imola weekend. But there is only so much teams, media and governing bodies can do before needing help from the social media platforms themselves. And that is appearing to be a major stumbling block.</p><p>As an FOM spokesperson said: "Formula 1 is a close community, and we all condemn these acts and will continue to work across the sport to collectively block and report abuse to social media platforms, but we need those platforms to be doing more to stop the spread of vile comments and abuse."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yqW4V0/s1000/f1-logo-lit-on-a-building-at-s.jpg" alt="F1 has waded into the debate and called on social media companies to do more" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">F1 has waded into the debate and called on social media companies to do more</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images</p><p>Meta, the parent company behind Instagram and Facebook, announced a sweeping reduction of content moderation at the start of the year, changes that were criticised by the company&rsquo;s oversight board for not doing enough to prevent the amplification of harmful content. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, the platform now branded as 'X' has also faced cuts to its global content moderation teams under the banner of free speech.</p><p>Governments have been grappling with the endemic issue of digital media's harmful influence on their population, too, with Australia recently banning children under 16 from using social media. Other administrations are closely studying Canberra's example.</p><p>Putting the social media genie back in the bottle is not an option. So, until platforms step up themselves or are being forced to, it might have to be up to all of us to educate and act responsibly, even if that means we are in for a rough ride.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-calls-on-social-media-platforms-to-step-up-fight-against-online-abuse/10724839/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YKE7jg80/s2/yuki-tsunoda-red-bull-racing-t.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">F1 calls on social media platforms to step up fight against online abuse</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Could McLaren’s commitment to 'let them race' be its downfall in F1 title fight? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The fight at the top of the Formula 1 drivers&rsquo; standings is heating up in 2025, with the leading three separated by just 22 points.</p><p>First and second is held by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/">Oscar Piastri</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/">Lando Norris</a> respectively, but could the team be better at handling the pair to boost its chances of winning a first double championship since 1998 - especially when title holder <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> remains in the battle.&nbsp;</p><p>So far this year, McLaren is refusing to give preferential treatment to either Piastri or Norris. The pair are on equal footing in terms of strategy and componentry, and each is fighting for their maiden world championship.</p><p>This equal footing extends to the pair&rsquo;s on-track antics, and team orders have rarely played a part in McLaren&rsquo;s strategy over a grand prix.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, when Norris was the lead McLaren and had a slim chance of toppling Verstappen for the crown, the Woking squad was initially reluctant to deploy team orders until it truly had to later in the year; boss Andrea Stella had said it was important to maintain the right balance within the squad.</p><p>But McLaren now has a genuine possibility of clinching both the drivers' and constructors' titles, the latter of which it clinched in 2024. So, this indecisive approach over who is its lead driver has led to fears that letting Norris and Piastri race could undo McLaren&rsquo;s hard work.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1y3Mx0/s1000/lando-norris-mclaren-oscar-pia.jpg" alt="Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>At last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, for example, the fight between McLaren&rsquo;s drivers was clear to see when third-placed Norris lined up behind Piastri in second for the late safety car restart. Despite the Briton running on much fresher tyres, Norris revealed that there was &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; in terms of team orders to ask Piastri to move out of his way, allowing his McLaren counterpart to chase down Verstappen.</p><p>In fact, Piastri himself admitted that he &ldquo;wasn't gonna give up without a fight&rdquo;, despite feeling that it was &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; Norris would overtake him on fresh rubber. &nbsp;</p><p>"It was tricky,&rdquo; the Australian said, as Norris eventually overtook with five laps remaining at the Tamburello chicane. &ldquo;I tried my best to hang on but yeah, just didn't have the grip and I tried my best.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>So far, the fighting on track hasn&rsquo;t ended in disaster. The pair hasn&rsquo;t come together in spectacular style like Mercedes rivals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nico-rosberg/2037/">Nico Rosberg</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/">Lewis Hamilton</a>&nbsp;did at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, or likewise with Red Bull pair Verstappen and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/daniel-ricciardo/9378/">Daniel Ricciardo</a> at Baku in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>But this doesn't mean that the fierce battle isn&rsquo;t affecting the team&rsquo;s chances of taking both titles. Had Piastri let Norris past sooner, the Briton would have had more time to try and catch Verstappen - even though Stella reckons the world champion was in another league.</p><p>&ldquo;We attempted to unlock various scenarios to try and beat Max,&rdquo; said Stella. &ldquo;But at no stage I think we saw that we had enough race pace.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXZ3Jp6/s1000/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-amg-f1-1.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W07 Hybrid and Nico Rosberg, Mercedes AMG F1 W07 Hybrid collide on the opening lap " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W07 Hybrid and Nico Rosberg, Mercedes AMG F1 W07 Hybrid collide on the opening lap</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>"Even with the final safety car, Lando could pass Oscar and try to push as much as possible. Pretty much Max was responding to Lando. So here to overtake you need seven, eight tenths of a second, so I think it's what it is. The main factor remains the swap of position and the outcome of lap one [when Verstappen overtook Piastri for the lead].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>But as Norris then failed to pass Verstappen, should McLaren have told him to give second back to Piastri? After all, Piastri is leading the standings and is, in some eyes, the favourite to win this year's crown. &nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Norris and Piastri are sat on 133 and 146 points respectively.

<![CDATA[ <p>Opel has become the first manufacturer to develop an all-electric rally car built to the FIA&rsquo;s new eRally5 regulations with the unveiling of its prototype Mokka GSE Rally.</p><p>The German manufacturer has been one of the leading marques in electric rally car production having enjoyed success with its Corsa Rally Electric, which is used in the ADAC Opel Electric Rally Cup, enjoying its fifth season this year.</p><p>Now the car maker has taken the covers off its latest electric rally car prototype, the Mokka GSE Rally which will make its debut at ELE Rally Eindhoven this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>The car is the first vehicle built to the FIA&rsquo;s eRally5 regulations devised in 2022 for cars largely based on two-wheel drive production-spec models featuring a stock motor, inverter and battery.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For more than four years, Opel and the ADAC have been demonstrating that electric rallying works and excites,&rdquo; said Opel and Vauxhall CEO Florian Huettl.</p><p>&ldquo;With our new Opel Mokka GSE Rally, we are offering a glimpse of a fully electric next generation rally car thanks to the latest motorsport technology the prototype offers strong performance and power aplenty.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YXRE1X50/s1000/opel-mokka-gse-rally.jpg" alt="Opel Mokka GSE Rally" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Opel Mokka GSE Rally</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Opel</p><p>According to Opel, the Mokka GSE Rally will deliver &ldquo;performance on a par with a Rally4 car&rdquo; with the vehicle producing a peak output of 207 kW (280 hp) and torque of 345 Newton metres.</p><p>It features a multi-plate limited-slip differential and a racing gearbox, together with reinforced drive shafts and wheel hubs bolted to a lightweight chassis.&nbsp;</p><p>The software tuning for the engine and battery management has been designed for maximum efficiency, driveability under competitive conditions and performance.</p><p>To ensure the highest safety standards, the car&rsquo;s battery is shrouded in a special casing. In the unlikely event of an insulation issue, a visual and acoustic warning system immediately reports a malfunction.</p><p>In the event of a sudden deceleration (such as in a collision), a sophisticated sensor system completely shuts down the high-voltage system in a few tenths of a second.</p><p>In addition, the Mokka GSE Rally has a special extinguishing system with electrically non-conductive extinguishing agent. Opel believes the Mokka GSE Rally could be ready for competition in 2026.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Star MotoGP rookie <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/fermin-aldeguer/945224/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fermin Aldeguer</a> is targeting a factory Ducati ride for 2027 but admits to being surprised to have already scored a maiden podium.</p><p>The Spaniard celebrated his <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/moto-gp-french-gp-johann-zarco-takes-shock-win-ahead-of-marc-marquez-in-thrilling-race/10721850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first podium in the premier class two weeks ago at Le Mans</a>, in just his sixth MotoGP Grand Prix.</p><p>However, it was a result that had been building for some time, as the Gresini rider had already impressed with a fifth place two rounds beforehand in Qatar.</p><p>"If someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I&rsquo;d be on the podium in my sixth MotoGP race, I would&rsquo;ve told them to go lie down," Aldeguer joked on Motorsport.com's Spanish language MotoGP podcast.</p><p>Aldeguer&rsquo;s season has steadily improved as he&rsquo;s become more comfortable with the Ducati. In Austin, the third stop on the calendar, he crashed out while chasing fourth after an incredible comeback; in Qatar, he was just seven seconds behind race winner <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/marc-marquez/17122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Marquez</a>; and at Le Mans, he stunned with back-to-back podiums &mdash; both in the sprint and the main race.</p><p>These results place him eighth in the overall standings, ahead of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/ai-ogura/445065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ai Ogura</a> (10th) and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/somkiat-chantra/314788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somkiat Chantra</a> (last), making him the best rookie so far.</p><p>Aldeguer's move to MotoGP was long-planned, having <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/ducati-announces-aldeguer-signing-for-2025-but-not-where-he-will-race/10588682/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been finalised at the end of 2023</a>. His deal, signed directly with Ducati, spans four years in two separate two-year phases. This structure not only gives him peace of mind to develop, but also a clear goal to aim for.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/01WVWLeY/s1000/fermin-aldeguer-gresini-racing.jpg" alt="Fermin Aldeguer, Gresini Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Fermin Aldeguer, Gresini Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Marc Fleury</p><p>At just 20 years old, Aldeguer believes that, if he continues progressing as expected, he could land a seat in Ducati&rsquo;s factory team in 2027 &mdash; the year both Marquez's and Francesco Bagnaia's contracts expire.</p><p>"The goal of every rookie riding for a satellite team is to end up in the factory team - I&rsquo;m lucky that my contract is directly with Ducati," he said.</p><p>"This year we pretty much have the same bike as the factory riders. Given my age and this contract, I&rsquo;ve got a bit of an advantage over the others.</p><p>"I have a four-year contract, two plus two. If my results are good, the jump to the factory team should happen in 2027. We&rsquo;ll see what happens, but that&rsquo;s the plan."</p><p>Aldeguer has also credited team-mate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/alex-marquez/20860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Marquez</a> for helping him to adapt to MotoGP so quickly with the pair working well together.</p><p>"Alex has opened the door for me in an incredible way - I expected that, given the kind of person he is, but he&rsquo;s gone above and beyond," said Aldeguer.</p><p>"One time, at the last minute, he changed his mind about the tyre he was going to use, and he came to my office &mdash; half-dressed in his undersuit &mdash; to tell me he'd changed his mind, just so I wouldn&rsquo;t think he was trying to trick me."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/johann-zarco-is-home-hero-while-francesco-bagnaia-misses-the-point-winners-and-losers-from-motogps-/10722123/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/2y3e7vX6/s2/johann-zarco-team-lcr-honda.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Mixed up weather leads to mixed up results: Winners and losers from MotoGP&rsquo;s French GP</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/its-experience-fermin-aldeguer-on-his-rise-to-a-motogp-sprint-race-podium-at-le-mans/10721660/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6D1y1Kw0/s2/fermin-aldeguer-gresini-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">&rdquo;It&rsquo;s experience&rdquo;: Fermin Aldeguer on his rise to a MotoGP Sprint race podium at Le Mans</a><p>Now that he&rsquo;s secured his first MotoGP podium, the next goal is, naturally, to take the top step. It&rsquo;s a challenge that motivates him and one he sees as possible, though he&rsquo;s not letting it become an obsession.</p><p>"Now I do believe it&rsquo;s possible to win a race in my first year, because I&rsquo;m feeling really good," Aldeguer said. "When it happens, it happens. Some tracks will suit me better, others worse.</p><p>"Of course, I&rsquo;d love for it to happen at Silverstone, where I got my first win in Moto2. But I&rsquo;m not going to lose my mind over it."</p><p>However, should he achieve that remarkable feat, it would make him the youngest winner in MotoGP history (20 years and 50 days), beating Marc Marquez&rsquo;s record by 13 days.</p> ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Formula 1 has urged social media platforms to take further steps to curb online abuse after <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/828523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuki Tsunoda</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jack-doohan/454760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a> were on the receiving end of toxic comments.</p><p>Franco Colapinto's F1 return with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> has reignited a swell of passionate support from his Argentinian homeland, but over the past months a minority of fans have repeatedly crossed the line by harassing Doohan, who was eventually replaced by Colapinto.</p><p>The matter came to a head at last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix when a post from a parody account fabricated an Instagram story by Doohan's father alleging to make fun of Colapinto's qualifying crash, which was reported as genuine by Argentinian media and further led to a torrent of abuse.</p><p>Tsunoda also landed in the crosshairs of Argentinian accounts after he and Colapinto were involved in a common and innocuous impeding incident in Friday practice at Imola, with the Red Bull driver abused for gesticulating towards Colapinto.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-fia-condemn-online-abuse-of-tsunoda-at-f1-imola-gp/10724615/" target="_self" rel="noopener">It led to calls from Alpine and the FIA for fans to treat all competitors with respect</a>, and Colapinto also urged his supporters to calm down, saying: "They are extremely passionate, and they are always very harsh on other people. They have to give respect."</p><p>Numerous Argentinian fans also responded to Tsunoda's Instagram posts with messages of support for the Japanese driver, apologising for the behaviour of others.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQRKOGY/s1000/franco-colapinto-alpine.jpg" alt="Franco Colapinto, Alpine" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Franco Colapinto, Alpine</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>F1's governing body, the FIA, has stepped up its efforts with a recently launched campaign to tackle online abuse, while F1 management and its teams have also been working to moderate comments received on their online accounts.</p><p>But when quizzed by Motorsport.com, FOM is now also calling on the social media platforms themselves to take decisive action.</p><p>"No one should be subject to abuse online or in any other form," FOM said in a statement provided to Motorsport.com.</p><p>"Jack Doohan and Yuki Tsunoda are great people, very talented drivers, and ambassadors for our sport who, along with their families, should be treated with respect rather than receive abuse by people who hide behind social media.</p><p>"Formula 1 is a close community, and we all condemn these acts and will continue to work across the sport to collectively block and report abuse to social media platforms, but we need those platforms to be doing more to stop the spread of vile comments and abuse."</p><p>Some of social media's biggest platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and the Meta company behind Instagram and Facebook, have ramped down their global content moderation efforts in recent months.</p><p>Speaking in Imola, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> driver <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> said he has recently cut back from using social media.</p><p>&ldquo;I enjoy not going on my phone as much as I used to," the Briton said. &ldquo;I just see social media more, from my perspective, as a waste of my time and energy, and I just don't need it."</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> laid the foundation for his victory at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix with a brilliant overtake on <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a> during lap one at Imola.</p><p>The Red Bull Formula 1 driver made a sweeping move around the outside of the Tamburello chicane to take a race lead he subsequently never lost.</p><p>Verstappen has made a habit of overtaking at race starts, so here&rsquo;s a look back at five other notable opening laps from the world champion, together with Imola 2025.&nbsp;</p><h2>Imola 2021</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2y3WqQK6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, at the start" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, at the start</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images</p><p>Starting in chronological order, the first is at the location where Verstappen passed Piastri last Sunday: the Autodromo Enzo e Dino <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/ferrari/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferrari</a>.</p><p>The Dutchman has now won four years in a row at Imola, with the first victory of the streak coming during the intense title battle with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> in 2021. The Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix was already the second race that season, following the opener in Bahrain.</p><p>In the Middle East, Hamilton and Verstappen had already battled, with Verstappen initially thinking he came out on top, only for the lead to be handed back after exceeding track limits.</p><p>In Imola, it came to the first real clash between the two title rivals &ndash; one of many that year. On a wet track, Hamilton and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/sergio-perez/9328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Perez</a> started from the front row, with Verstappen in P3. However, unlike 2025, the Dutchman made a good start and by the time they reached the first chicane he was already alongside pole-sitter Hamilton.&nbsp;</p><p>Verstappen claimed the inside line at Tamburello, with Hamilton trying to hold his ground on the outside &ndash; as the outside would become the inside on the second part of the chicane. However, there wasn't enough room for two cars and Hamilton ended up off the track, losing part of his front wing over the sausage kerbs.</p><p>This successful overtake gave Verstappen the lead, which he would convert into a win in a rather tumultuous race. Hamilton finished 22 seconds behind the Red Bull driver in second, but was fortunate after ending up in the gravel trap on lap 31 and having to reverse out. A red flag caused by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/valtteri-bottas/13082/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valtteri Bottas</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> saved the seven-time world champion from further disaster.</p><h2>Mexico 2021</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXZlqz6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes W12, Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL35M, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB16B, and the rest of the field at the start" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB16B, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W12, Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes W12, Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL35M, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB16B, and the rest of the field at the start</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images</p><p>The race in Imola was a precursor to a historic F1 season. When the F1 circus arrived in Mexico later that year, the tension was already reaching a boiling point.</p><p>Verstappen had just won a modern classic in Austin the week before but needed to win in Mexico City as well, as that track was considered favourable for Red Bull due to the high altitude. However, Verstappen&rsquo;s qualifying didn&rsquo;t go as planned, meaning he had to line up third for Sunday&rsquo;s race, giving <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> the perfect opportunity with a front row lockout. With Bottas on pole and Hamilton alongside him, pre-race discussions mainly centred around the question: how could the Mercedes duo hold off Verstappen on the long straight leading to the first chicane?</p><p>Despite all pre-race discussions, Mercedes could not convert the front row advantage into the desired result. The way Verstappen struck was very similar to his recent overtake in Imola.</p><p>In Mexico, Verstappen took advantage of Bottas&rsquo; slipstream, who had Hamilton on the inside. The Finn left the outside line completely open, allowing Verstappen to get alongside, with the three cars heading towards the first corner.</p><p>Just like in Imola 2025, Verstappen was on the grippier racing line, allowing him to brake significantly later than his competitors and take the lead. For Bottas, it went from bad to worse in the opening lap, as he was spun around by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/daniel-ricciardo/9378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Ricciardo</a>. All this happened far behind Verstappen, who won by over 16 seconds. It would be his last win before the nerve-wracking climax of the 2021 season in Abu Dhabi.</p><h2>Belgium 2022</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXrv9M6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images</p><p>Half a year later, the competitive landscape in F1 looked completely different. The 2021 machines were replaced by ground-effect cars under the new regulations. While Mercedes suffered from porpoising, Ferrari was the early-season pacesetter.&nbsp;</p><p>Verstappen suffered from two DNF&rsquo;s in Bahrain and Australia and stated that it would take him 46 races to catch-up. But by the end of August, when the field arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for the first race after the summer break, Red Bull already had the dominant package. Verstappen clocked the fastest time in qualifying, with more than half a second lead over second-placed <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/109611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>. However, due to grid penalties for changing engine components, Verstappen had to start from P14 on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/carlos-sainz/15916/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Sainz</a> and Perez, starting from the front row, fancied their chances, but after the first lap, Verstappen was already in P8. With Pierre Gasly's grid slot empty, Verstappen overtook Bottas, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nicholas-latifi/19443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas Latifi</a>, and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kevin-magnussen/15905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Magnussen</a> at the start, moving up to 10th by the time he reached La Source hairpin.</p><p>From there, the championship leader played it safe, especially when <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lance-stroll/20950/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Stroll</a> went off the track twice in front of him. It underlined Red Bull&rsquo;s dominance: the car was quick enough, so Verstappen didn&rsquo;t need to take any risks.&nbsp;</p><p>On lap 12, he eventually passed team-mate Perez for the lead, completing a remarkable charge through the field from P14 to victory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Japan 2022</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1P9P90/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>Strictly speaking, this wasn&rsquo;t an overtaking move. However, the way Verstappen held onto the lead in the first corner of Suzuka has to be included in the list of his best first-lap moves.</p><p>In the Land of the Rising Sun, rain was pouring down before the race, and all teams had their tents up on the grid. When the action finally started with a standing start, Leclerc had a much better getaway than Verstappen. The Ferrari driver was slightly ahead and had the inside line going into the first corner, but Verstappen took more risk on the outside and managed to retake the lead.</p><p>Once again, Verstappen found more grip on the racing line, though this was relative in the rain. He later mentioned he absolutely wanted to keep the lead, as it would give him clear visibility.</p><p>However, that clear visibility was short-lived. After chaos in the opening lap and very poor visibility for the rest of the field, the race was red-flagged after the second lap. Following the long-awaited restart, Verstappen pulled away from the competition by 27 seconds in a shortened 28-lap race, though the early red flag caused confusion about whether full points would be awarded.</p><p>Verstappen himself was unsure as well, leading to amusing scenes behind the podium. "Should I sit there? But I&rsquo;m not champion yet? Oh, I am? No, I&rsquo;m not, right? I am? Are you sure?" When he was eventually confirmed as world champion, his manager Raymond Vermeulen smiled and told Motorosport.com in the paddock: "It seems that things can never go normally with us."</p><h2>Brazil 2024</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jXPp5g6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, overtakes Esteban Ocon, Alpine A524 " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, overtakes Esteban Ocon, Alpine A524</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lubomir Asenov / Motorsport Images</p><p>After a dominant 2023 season, Verstappen had to fight harder for the world title in 2024. Red Bull started the year strong, but from the Miami Grand Prix onward, the season took a dramatic turn as <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> became the strongest team.</p><p>But thanks to an update in Austin, things improved slightly for Red Bull during the final third of the season, yet Verstappen still needed one more win to seal the championship. That victory came in Brazil, although it didn&rsquo;t look like it after a delayed qualifying session on Sunday morning. Verstappen got eliminated in Q2 due to a late red flag and had to start from P17 on a grid after taking an engine penalty.</p><p>&ldquo;It was an emotional rollercoaster. After qualifying, I was extremely frustrated when I got back to my room,&rdquo; Verstappen said.</p><p>But when the lights went out, the Dutchman was determined not to let his title hopes slip away with title rival <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> on pole. By the end of the first three corners, Verstappen was already in P11, having chosen the outside line at the Senna S &ndash; a move that had worked for him in 2016 as well, overtaking <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/nico-rosberg/2037/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nico Rosberg</a> around the outside.</p><p>Verstappen then overtook Hamilton at the start-finish straight at the end of the first lap, meaning he was already in the points. It turned out to be the start of perhaps the most complete race of his career: winning in the Brazilian rain and taking a big step towards the fourth title that he would eventually secure in Las Vegas.</p><h2>Imola 2025</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0mbBdNq2/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>The most recent example is, of course, Imola 2025. This time Verstappen started from the front row, next to polesitter and championship leader Piastri, but had a poor start. The Red Bull driver also saw George Russell passing him, momentarily dropping Verstappen to third.</p><p>However, he positioned his RB21 well. After checking both mirrors, Verstappen ensured that Russell couldn&rsquo;t come across, preventing the Mercedes driver from taking the outside line. At the same time, he left less than a car&rsquo;s width on the right to prevent Norris from diving into that gap. The Dutch driver kept the outside line clear, which was crucial for the move that followed.</p><p>Verstappen benefitted from the extra grip on the racing line, lifting and braking about 10 metres later than Piastri. The McLaren driver admitted he was too cautious and would have approached it differently with hindsight. Verstappen entered the braking zone about 30 km/h faster than Piastri and took that momentum into the corner.</p><p>It was enough to take the lead and manage the race with a surprisingly strong pace. The situation was completely different from four years ago &ndash; the start of this list &ndash; but could it nonetheless be a sign of a title battle that lasts all the way to the final race in Abu Dhabi? Only time will tell...</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The voting panel had to choose two names from the Modern Era Ballot and one from the Pioneer Ballot on Tuesday, ultimately deciding on the following individuals: <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kurt-busch/382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurt Busch</a> (Modern), Harry Gant (Modern), and Ray Hendrick (Pioneer).</p><p>Busch and Gant both received 61% of the Modern Era ballot votes. Jeff Burton finished third, followed by Harry Hyde and Randy Dorton. Hendrick received 31% of the Pioneer ballot votes with Bob Welborn finishing second.</p><p>Humpy Wheeler was also honored with the Landmark Achievement Award, which recognizes those who have&nbsp;made significant and impactful contributions to the world of NASCAR.</p><h2>Kurt Busch</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2jX4AqE6/s1000/kurt-busch-stewart-haas-racing.jpg" alt="Kurt Busch, Stewart-Haas Racing Ford" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Kurt Busch, Stewart-Haas Racing Ford</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sean Gardner / Getty Images</p><p>It's no surprise that Busch, a first-ballot nominee, has been voted into the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.&nbsp;He is the only NASCAR Cup Series champion among the Modern Era Ballot nominees this year, and no one can argue against his skill behind the wheel of a stock car.</p><p>Busch won 34 Cup races, doing so with five different organizations and four different manufacturers (the only driver to do so). Busch still had more races to win as well, if not for a career-ending crash at Pocono in 2022. A multi-time race winner in the Xfinity and Truck Series, his Cup triumphs also include the 2017 Daytona 500, the 2010 Coke 600, and the 2010 All-Star Race.&nbsp;</p><h2>Harry Gant</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/24vxqb46/s1000/harry-gant.jpg" alt="Harry Gant" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Harry Gant</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: ISC Archives - Getty Images for NASCAR</p><p>Gant holds the honor of being the oldest winner in NASCAR Cup Series history, winning 52 years and eight months in 1992. His career included 18 Cup wins, all achieved while driving the iconic No. 33 Skoal Bandit car. He was the 1984 NASCAR Cup Series championship runner-up and earned the nickname 'Mr. September' for winning so many races during that time of year. In fact, Gant is one of the few drivers in the modern era to have successfully won four consecutive Cup races. Gant's remarkable career also includes two victories in the prestigious Southern 500, winning the iconic Darlington event in both 1984 and 1991.</p><h2>Ray Hendrick</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0JB3KpE0/s1000/ray-hendrick.jpg" alt="Ray Hendrick" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Ray Hendrick</p><p>The original "Mr Modified," Hendrick and his winged No. 11 dominated the short track scene for many years, winning over 700 Modified and Late Model races throughout his career. This included 20 Modified races at the historic Martinsville Speedway. His achievements have already gotten him recognized as one of NASCAR's 50 Best Drivers in 1998 and again as one of NASCAR's 75 Best Drivers in 2023.</p><p>The Class of 2026 Induction Ceremony is set to take place on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026 at the NASCAR Hall of Fame and Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/" target="_self" rel="noopener">IndyCar</a> Series is heading to the <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/the-complete-starting-grid-for-the-109th-running-of-the-indianapolis-500/10724305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">109th Indianapolis 500 this Sunday</a> <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/penskes-modifications-arent-the-actual-problem-the-fact-that-no-one-caught-them-is/10724722/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid a rules infraction by Team Penske</a>. Modified rear attenuators found on the No. 12 and No. 2 cars during Sunday&rsquo;s Fast 12 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway led to an&nbsp;initial decision to make <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/14914/">Josef Newgarden</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/will-power/4712/">Will Power</a> start 11th and 12th in the upcoming race and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/will-power-and-josef-newgarden-will-start-last-in-indy-500/10724487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new penalties arriving Monday that sent them to the back of the field</a>. Team Penske received other punishments as well.</p><p>McLaren driver, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/patricio-o-ward/109456/">Pato O'Ward</a> was one of the first drivers to express an opinion about the matter, and it was a strong one. When addressing the media following his front-row start in Fast 6, he said that both cars should have been sent to the last-chance qualifier.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/pato-oward-penske-cars-should-have-been-sent-to-lcq-after-rules-breach/10724301/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQR9k1Y/s2/patricio-o-ward-arrow-mclaren.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Pato O'Ward: Penske cars should have been sent to LCQ after rules breach</a><p>In an interview with Motorsport.com, the Mexican driver emphasized the significance of this technical infraction by Team Penske, given the magnitude of the Indianapolis 500.</p><p>&ldquo;My answer was never to force IndyCar into a decision. I think that's just something that naturally had to come about. You need to put yourself in the position of the guy that's going home (Jacob Abel). I think he doesn't want to be a part of this event just because of the technicality of someone else, but there's so much that goes into this event. It's a world-class event. This is not a national event. This is a world-class event. It's so important to make sure that we're fighting all in an even playing field. At least with legality.&rdquo;</p><p>For O'Ward, it's impossible to overlook the fact that the owner of the offending team, Roger Penske, also owns the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He sees Team Penske as the benchmark and questions the example the organization is setting.</p><p>&ldquo;It's important to also realize that while there's so much at stake. The team that is also doing these infractions owns the series. They own the Speedway. They own the series. They are the benchmark. They're the heroes to many of us. We are the underdogs striving to be like them. We are the team that's striving to beat them. What example are you setting? First of all for your fans. Second of all for the honor of your own series. And three: what are you showing people? Are you doing that because you don't believe in your drivers? You've got amazing drivers in your team. I get that we're always pushing the limits of what's legal or not in order to gain that advantage, (but) it's not a good look."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/penskes-modifications-arent-the-actual-problem-the-fact-that-no-one-caught-them-is/10724722/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQR9WKY/s2/josef-newgarden-team-penske.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Penske&rsquo;s modifications aren&rsquo;t entirely the problem, the fact that no one caught them is</a><p>The technical breach that came to light last Sunday is the second involving Team Penske in 14 months, following <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/why-penske-push-to-pass-scandal-presses-all-the-wrong-buttons-for-indycar/10605506/" target="_self" rel="noopener">a double disqualification for using an illegal push-to-pass system in St. Petersburg last year</a>. Additionally, O&rsquo;Ward stated that there were other infractions for which Penske was fined but managed privately.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not sure if many people know. They've been caught twice already in a span of a year. These are the only two times that it's been public. But it hasn't been the only two times. There's been another two or three things that they've caught about them, IndyCar Tech, where they just received fines. But ultimately it's not a good look. It's not a good look at all. Whether it's become public or not. This one obviously was very public. But some of the other things are also performance enhancers. For the race cars, not for the drivers. Those were not public. It was: 'Oh, something was off.' And they just got a fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They don't have to be doing this. Especially when the first thing people are going to go to is a conflict of interest. Because they obviously own the series. And no one's going to be doing extra work just for the aesthetic of something. That is just the biggest BS I've ever heard. You will do this to gain an advantage and to be better and faster. You're not going to do this just because it looks better.&rdquo;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/why-penske-push-to-pass-scandal-presses-all-the-wrong-buttons-for-indycar/10605506/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/68yr5jV0/s2/josef-newgarden-team-penske-ch.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Why Penske push-to-pass scandal presses all the wrong buttons for IndyCar</a><p>O&rsquo;Ward lost the Indianapolis 500 last year after a final-lap battle with Newgarden, during which the Penske driver overtook his Arrow McLaren rival to secure the victory. The car is now at the renovated IMS Museum and features a modified rear attenuator similar to the one seen on Sunday. While the car doesn't necessarily need to be exactly as it was at the end of the race, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/penskes-modifications-arent-the-actual-problem-the-fact-that-no-one-caught-them-is/10724722/" target="_self" rel="noopener">there are also reports of photos from that day where the Team Penske Chevrolet No. 2 appears to have it, too</a>.</p><p>When asked about it, O&rsquo;Ward said the focus should be on what can&rsquo;t be seen from the Penske cars, considering their performance. However, he plans to use this as motivation as he bids for his first win in the 500.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I feel like in a certain way it explains the unexplainable. From a gap that you wouldn't be able to see any other car on the grid close. At that moment, at least in the last lap, the way that he just caught up even when the toe was broken a bit and just cleared. Like the speed, the natural speed of those cars currently. Even without this piece. What makes me wonder is that... that's something we can see. I wonder what else and what other things are among those cars that we cannot see, that explain the ability to do some of the things where you're like 'How are they doing this?' But I don't want to get into it really. I think that's just more motivation to when we actually get it done and we beat them. It's going to feel real good.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ How an F1 team lost a $300K diamond at the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>It&rsquo;s a scene that feels plucked straight from a Hollywood heist movie &mdash; only art imitated life a little too closely. In May 2004, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Formula 1</a> descended on the principality of Monaco for its annual display of speed, opulence and wealth, but one glittering object stood out above all else: a $300,000 diamond on the nose cone of Jaguar&rsquo;s car. What could go wrong?&nbsp;</p><p>The massive rock - which disappeared during the Grand Prix - was part of an outlandish marketing stunt that resulted in one of the sport&rsquo;s most bizarre unsolved mysteries. At the time, Jaguar Racing - which was owned by Ford - was underperforming, and desperately clinging to anything that would help them maintain relevance.&nbsp;</p><p>With the George Clooney-led <em>Ocean&rsquo;s Twelve</em> movie about to hit cinemas, a group of marketing execs from Jaguar, and the film&rsquo;s production company Warner Brothers, came up with an idea. They decided to lean into the movie&rsquo;s premise of stealing jewels (though the film was about the theft of a Faberge Egg) by placing two massive diamonds - that were uninsured - on the front of Jaguar&rsquo;s cars.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1P8590/s1000/promoting-the-film-oceans-twel-1.jpg" alt="Promoting the film Oceans Twelve with the Jaguar team: George Clooney, Actor; Christian Klien, Jaguar; Brad Pitt, Actor; Mark Webber, Jaguar" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Promoting the film Oceans Twelve with the Jaguar team: George Clooney, Actor; Christian Klien, Jaguar; Brad Pitt, Actor; Mark Webber, Jaguar</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sutton Images</p><p>They partnered with diamond trader Steinmetz, who provided two 1.4-carat white diamonds for <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/mark-webber/65/">Mark Webber</a> and rookie <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/christian-klien/4103/">Christian Klien</a>'s cars, valued at around $300,000 each. When adjusted for inflation, that&rsquo;s more than $1M worth of jewels. Even Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were on-hand to help promote the stunt. But there was one problem: it seems nobody had considered what would happen if they crashed.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2004 Monaco Grand Prix was only Klien&rsquo;s sixth F1 race. An uninsured diamond placed on one of the most fragile parts of an F1 car, being driven by a rookie around a street track that&rsquo;s known for claiming front ends. You simply can&rsquo;t make this up!&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/100000/150000/158000/158900/158994/s1000/f1-monaco-gp-2004-jaguar-racing-and-steinmetz-present-the-diamond-jaguar-r5-the-diamond-ja.jpg" alt="Jaguar Racing and Steinmetz present the Diamond Jaguar R5: the Diamond Jaguar R5 complete with a diamond set in the nose to promote the film Oceans 12" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Jaguar Racing and Steinmetz present the Diamond Jaguar R5: the Diamond Jaguar R5 complete with a diamond set in the nose to promote the film Oceans 12</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jaguar Cars and Wieck Media Services, Inc.</p><p>On the first lap, Klien hit a barrier at Loews hairpin and lightly damaged the front end of his car. He emerged from the crash unscathed and retired from the race, but the diamond was gone, never to be seen again. The team&rsquo;s spokesman, Nav Sidhu, who was heavily involved in the &lsquo;Ocean&rsquo;s Twelve&rsquo; sponsorship later said, "At that point, I probably should've been worried about the car or the driver. But, I must admit, my immediate thought was for the diamond."</p><p>But there was no trace of the prized jewel when the car was returned to the garage after the race two hours later, and rumors quickly began swirling. Without footage of the crash, multiple theories started to take hold. Some wondered whether the diamond had become lodged in the barrier, or swept up with other debris and washed out to sea through a storm drain.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YXRrvn70/s1000/christian-klien-jaguar-r5-1.jpg" alt="Christian Klien, Jaguar R5" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Christian Klien, Jaguar R5</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images</p><p>Others have suggested the diamond flew off before the impact of the crash (after all, it was reportedly only stuck on the car with glue) and was pocketed by an opportunistic spectator or marshal. Others even theorized that the real diamond was never on the car, and Jaguar switched it out for a replica at the last minute, though Sidhu vehemently denied that theory.&nbsp;</p><p>All&rsquo;s well that ends well, however, as Jaguar got exactly what it wanted from the stunt: publicity. The story made international news for weeks afterward, and though 2004 marked Jaguar&rsquo;s last year in F1, the team was purchased by Red Bull, who would go on to become one of the sport&rsquo;s winningest teams.&nbsp;</p><p>More than two decades on, the sheer lunacy of the diamond&rsquo;s disappearance continues to capture the imagination of F1 fans. It&rsquo;s almost unthinkable that a room of executives would approve a six-figure gemstone being stuck on the nose of a car driving around the notoriously tight streets of Monaco. If the jewel&nbsp;was&nbsp;picked up by a lucky onlooker, they hold a glittering piece of F1 history from one of the sport&rsquo;s most expensive DNFs of all-time.&nbsp;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-pirelli-controversial-new-tyre-will-shape-monaco-gp-beyond/10724523/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/27vdDVx0/s2/andrea-kimi-antonelli-mercedes-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">How Pirelli's controversial new tyre will shape the Monaco GP and beyond</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/lewis-hamilton-says-brake-performance-has-felt-like-a-lottery-in-2025/10723476/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6n9ZQQXY/s2/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Lewis Hamilton says brake performance has felt like a &lsquo;lottery&rsquo; in 2025</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-carbone-beach-the-most-exclusive-event-on-the-f1-calendar/10723329/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/Yv87xqE0/s2/patrick-mahomes-and-tom-brady-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Inside Carbone Beach: The most exclusive event on the F1 calendar</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Who's next? The first-time winners of NASCAR's grueling Coke 600 ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>It's a bit strange to think that inexperienced drivers seem to shine in this grueling five-hour marathon, but it's happened enough for it to become notable. At 600 miles, no other NASCAR race gets close to the length of the Coca Cola 600.</p><p>Born from the minds of&nbsp;Bruton Smith&nbsp;and&nbsp;Curtis Turner, the 1.5-mile asphalt oval known as Charlotte Motor Speedway is now the heartbeat of the NASCAR community with a majority of teams and drivers living within a short drive of the track.</p><p>The race was originally called the World 600 and ran its inaugural event in 1960. Its&nbsp;first victor was Joe Lee Johnson in the No. 89 machine. It wasn't his first win, but it was his last, winning the race by a margin of four laps. But as for the event's first-time winners,&nbsp; some became legends while others were no more than one-hit-wonders. But nearly all of them had to beat established titans of the sport to get the job done. Let's take a look at the complete list of first-time winners and how they all managed to conquer NASCAR's longest race.</p><h2>1961 - David Pearson</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6VR5kr46/s1000/david-pearson-1979-nascar-1.jpg" alt="David Pearson 1979 NASCAR" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">David Pearson 1979 NASCAR</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: NASCAR Media</p><p>This NASCAR Hall of Famer would go on to win three championships and 105 races in a career that spanned nearly 30 years, but his first win came right at Charlotte in 1961. After starting third, he led over half the race in a dominant showing, beating the legendary Fireball Roberts by two full laps. His 105 career victories ranks second only to Richard Petty.</p><p>Pearson's triumph in the second-ever running of the race appeared to be an anomaly at first. It would be 33 years until a first-time winner won the 600 again, but it was name that every single race fan now knows.</p><h2>1994 - <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jeff-gordon/24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Gordon</a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2QzAjOOY/s1000/jeff-gordon-leads-coke-600.jpg" alt="Jeff Gordon leads Coke 600" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Jeff Gordon leads Coke 600</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: ISC Archives - Getty Images for NASCAR</p><p>At just 22 years old, 'Wonder Boy' was piloting the No. 24 <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/hendrick-motorsports/70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hendrick Motorsports</a> Chevrolet that he would later make famous. But at the time, he was still searching for his first career win. This race appeared to be Rusty Wallace's to lose but with the brilliant Ray Evernham on the box, he and Gordon proved to be a formidable duo. A call for a short two-tire stop allowed them to jump ahead of Wallace late in the running. He led just 16 laps but it was enough to claim his first Cup win, defeating the 1989 Cup Series champion.</p><p>Of course, we all know Gordon didn't stop there. The Hall of Fame driver went on to win 93 Cup races and sits just behind Pearson on the all-time wins list. He also won four Cup titles, eclipsing Pearson in that category.</p><h2>1995 - <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/bobby-labonte/30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobby Labonte</a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/0/80000/85000/85800/85836/s1000/nascar-cup-richmond-2003-bobby-labonte.jpg" alt="Bobby Labonte" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Bobby Labonte</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Greg Gage</p><p>We certainly didn't have to wait another 33 years for the next first-time winner after Gordon's big win. The very next year, another future Hall of Fame would make their mark with a win in NASCAR's longest race. Ken Schrader was in control, but blew an engine late in the running.</p><p>Bobby Labonte moved into the race lead and stretched the fuel to take the checkered flag. It was also Labonte 1-2 with his elder brother and two-time Cup Series champion Terry finishing second. Bobby went on to become the 2000 Cup Series champion, winning 21 races, and joining the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2020.</p><h2>2000 - <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/matt-kenseth/29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Kenseth</a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/0/10000/17000/17600/17695/s1000/nascar-cup-new-hampshire-300-2-2001-matt-kenseth.jpg" alt="Matt Kenseth" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Matt Kenseth</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Autostock</p><p>The theme of first-time winners in the 600 going on to become NASCAR legends continued as the sport raced into the 21st century. Matt Kenseth, running fourth after the final restart, quickly marched forward with the cunning one would expect from a veteran driver. He passed Gordon, Earnhardt, and finally Labonte on Lap 373 of 400. He then held back Labonte as they navigated slower traffic, winning the race by just over half a second.</p><p>Kenseth won 39 Cup races throughout his career and was the final champion under the season-long points format in 2003. He was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame just last year. That's right. The first four drivers to get their maiden Cup win the 600 all went on to become Cup champions and members of the sport's Hall of Fame.&nbsp;</p><h2>2007 - <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/casey-mears/422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casey Mears</a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/500000/500000/505000/505100/505159/s1000/nascar-cup-charlotte-2007-victory-lane-race-winner-casey-mears-celebrates.jpg" alt="Victory lane: race winner Casey Mears celebrates" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Victory lane: race winner Casey Mears celebrates</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Motorsport.com / ASP Inc.</p><p>This is where the trend started to shift a bit. Underdogs began to rise from the midfield and snatch this crown jewel victory for themselves. After a few years of struggle at Chip Ganassi Racing, Casey Mears, nephew of four-time Indy 500 winner Rick Mears, joined Hendrick Motorsports for the 2007 season. It was still a struggle for Mears and the No. 25 team, but the Coke 600 presented him with a unique opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>With everyone running on fumes, Mears watched as <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/tony-stewart/33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Stewart</a> pitted from the lead with just eight laps to go. Then,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/dale-earnhardt-jr/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> pitted from the lead as well, and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/denny-hamlin/6539/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denny Hamlin</a> the lap after him. With just six laps to go, Mears inherited the top spot. He peddled that car, hanging on to win the race with 9.5s advantage over J.J. Yeley. Those final six laps were the only laps he led during the entire 400-lap event.</p><p>While it was Mears' first trip to Victory Lane, unlike the previous drivers on this list, it was also his last. He started 489 Cup races between 2003 and 2019, but that 2007 Coke 600 was his only moment of glory.&nbsp;</p><h2>2009 - David Reutimann</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/800000/840000/843000/843100/843171/s1000/nascar-cup-charlotte-2009-victory-lane-david-reutimann-celebrates.jpg" alt="Victory lane: David Reutimann celebrates" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Victory lane: David Reutimann celebrates</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Motorsport.com / ASP Inc.</p><p>The 2009 Coke 600 was plagued by bad weather and was already postponed to Monday. Running a day late with weather still threatening, the rain returned on Lap 222 of 400. then on lap 222 of 400. David Reutimann was running 14th at the time of the yellow with no hope of victory. However, teams were closing in on needing fuel, so most the field decided to pit during the caution. But Reutimann did not. He led five laps behind the pace car before the rain intensified and forced NASCAR to red flag the event.</p><p>And it never resumed, giving us an upset win by both driver and team, as <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/michael-waltrip/36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Waltrip</a> Racing had never won a race before either. It was an underdog story for the ages, and one of two Cup wins in Reutimann's career. He went on to win his second and final race the following year at Chicagoland Speedway -- no rain needed.</p><h2>2017 - <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/austin-dillon/14661/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin Dillon</a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RKlNNv2/s1000/nascar-cup-charlotte-2017-race-winner-austin-dillon-richard-childress-racing-chevrolet.jpg" alt="Race winner Austin Dillon, Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Race winner Austin Dillon, Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: NASCAR Media</p><p>The grandson of Richard Childress, Dillon was the first driver to pilot the No. 3 car in the Cup Series since the passing of Dale Earnhardt in 2001. And similar to the race from a decade earlier where Mears won, the 2017 Coke 600 became an intense fuel-mileage race. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/martin-truex-jr/1975/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Truex Jr</a>. had absolutely dominated the event, but he did not have enough fuel to make it to the end.</p><p>Several drivers tried and failed to stretch it. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jimmie-johnson/639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jimmie Johnson</a> was leading with just two laps to go, but he ran out exiting Turn 2 with about 2.25 miles left in the 600-mile race.</p><p>Dillon was now in control, but he had no room to breathe as both Truex and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-busch/17035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Busch</a> were closing in fast. Even if he had enough fuel, there was still a real chance they might reach him anyway, but they did not get there in time. Busch crossed the line just eight tenths back of the No. 3 car, which carried Austin Dillon to his first career win after leading only the final two laps. Had that been a 601 mile race, the result would have looked very different.</p><p>Dillon is the only driver on this list who is still competing at the Cup level. He went on to win the 2018 Daytona 500, collecting another crown jewel. He also has victories at Texas Motor Speedway in 2022, the summer Daytona race in 2023, and a highly controversial victory at Richmond in 2024. In doing so, he is actually the most successful driver on this list who hasn't actually won (or even come close) to a Cup Series title.</p><h2>Who's next?</h2><p>Since Dillon's win in 2017, there have been no first-time winners in the Coke 600. In fact, the trend has shifted back towards the more experienced drivers. Nearly every Coke 600 victor after Dillon is now a NASCAR Cup Series champion, with the exception of Denny Hamlin and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/christopher-bell/16942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Bell</a>, and both are consistent championship contenders.</p><p>Recent outcomes tell us that another veteran will likely take the checkered flag this weekend, but I believe we're due for another first-time winner. But if that happens, who could it be?</p><p>Perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/ty-gibbs/825881/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ty Gibbs</a>, who has yet to win despite some very impressive performances. The 2022 NASCAR Xfinity Series champion is making his 100th career start in the NASCAR Cup Series this weekend, driving the No. 54 <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/joe-gibbs-racing/80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Gibbs Racing</a> Toyota. He has placed as high as sixth in the 600 and is certainly due for a trip to Victory Lane with 563 laps led at the Cup level, but his recent struggles have confused many. Gibbs has the equipment and is a proven champion in lower divisions, so what is missing?</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6VRpQDV6/s1000/ty-gibbs-joe-gibbs-racing-toyo.jpg" alt="Ty Gibbs, Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Ty Gibbs, Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Jared C.

<![CDATA[ Why F1 Imola GP was still positive for Aston Martin despite no points ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Aston Martin&rsquo;s history with upgrades is rocky to say the least, with the British team often struggling to find form once it starts strapping new parts to its Formula 1 car.</p><p>At Imola last weekend, for example, the British side brought a raft of updates to the AMR25 and still left the Italian track without a point, leaving it seventh in the championship.</p><p>But Aston Martin is a side undergoing regeneration, having recently moved into an impressive new campus and added star hirings like Adrian Newey. It also has one of the newest wind tunnels on the current grid, which finally burst into life just as the 2025 season started.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is why Aston Martin&rsquo;s start to 2025, including it only finishing 11th (<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Alonso</a>) and 15th (<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lance-stroll/20950/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Stroll</a>) at Imola, adds to the frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It's one of those where you can certainly be disappointed about missing out on a point by less than a second,&rdquo; said Andy Cowell, Aston Martin team principal.</p><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t quite tell the whole story of the squad&rsquo;s weekend, as it showed real promise until the grand prix. Stroll qualified eighth, his highest of the season so far, while Alonso placed his AMR25 in fifth &ndash; his best performance since the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKE71Bk0/s1000/andy-cowell-aston-martin-racin.jpg" alt="Andy Cowell, Aston Martin Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Andy Cowell, Aston Martin Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>As a result, the pair seemed nailed on for a points-paying finish, yet a combination of a full safety car plus a virtual safety car scuppered Aston Martin's chances as others received a free stop.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Cowell still said there are positives the team can take from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.</p><p>&ldquo;The positive is we've brought an update that's made the car quicker and, up to the point that a random VSC [virtual safety car] comes out, everything was going OK,&rdquo; Cowell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, I think in the moment everybody's despondent, but I think by tomorrow everybody will be like &lsquo;right come on let's do more of that, let's look at all the areas of the car and how do we push more&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling was echoed by Alonso after the race, as he said the team &ldquo;finally&rdquo; had a &ldquo;strong car that can score points on merit&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This marks a stark contrast to this time last year, when Aston Martin started upgrading its AMR24 and performance appeared to go backwards. Now, the team has finally managed to bring new parts that make a real difference on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/27vdqlm0/s1000/safety-car.jpg" alt="Safety car" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Safety car</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Luca Bruno / Pool / AFP via Getty Images</p><p>&ldquo;The thing we were struggling with last year was that we were creating updates that might be good at a high-speed circuit but worse at a low speed,&rdquo; Cowell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What we've done is bring an update that is good at low-, medium- and high-speed and so that is a positive step forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly how much quicker is it? I'm not going to declare. I'll tell you in Abu Dhabi [the season finale].&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And the team clearly has faith in the new parts. It elected to run Friday&rsquo;s practice session at Imola with one driver using the old spec AMR25 and the other using the upgraded model. This gave Aston data to directly compare the two on the same track and in the same conditions, which Cowell says shows that on &ldquo;every single corner the package was better&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, the launch spec of the AMR25 was signed off in January, while the upgrades left the wind tunnel once the 2025 season got under way in March. This means that these upgrades are the first parts to be developed with the team's new wind tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the data Aston collected at Imola will enable the team to better calibrate its new tunnel, which will help set it on the right path for its next phase of upgrades. This, Cowell says, means that Aston is finally moving in the &ldquo;right direction&rdquo; as it works to transform its season and prepare for F1&rsquo;s new ruleset in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>So, while Aston Martin may be disappointed to not add any extra points to its haul at Imola, the data and learnings it takes away from the race could prove to be even more pivotal to the side&rsquo;s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren and Ben Hunt</em></p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/antonelli-needs-to-learn-to-say-no-after-draining-imola-f1-home-race/10724712/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YW78jgDY/s2/andrea-kimi-antonelli-mercedes-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Antonelli "needs to learn to say no" after draining Imola F1 home race</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-technical-directives-imola-gp-did-any-impact/10724635/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6gpl1pl0/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">FIA issued technical directives before Imola GP, but did they have any impact?</a> ]]>

They have actually existed for over a year and made appearances at multiple types of tracks.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is a rear attenuator?</h2><p>In order to understand what transpired at Team Penske, we need to start with the function of the rear attenuator on an IndyCar. This rectangular piece sits at the back of the car and is attached to the gearbox where it serves two basic roles. Its primary role is to absorb impact in a crash and reduce the g-forces felt by the driver. It also serves as the mount for the rain light assembly.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/indycar-attentuator-and-rain-r.jpg" alt="Side-by-side comparison of an Indy car's rear attenuator" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Side-by-side comparison of an Indy car's rear attenuator</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: IndyCar</p><p>The current base version of the rear attenuator <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/indycar-reveals-safety-tech-procedural-changes-for-2023/10436095/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was revealed by IndyCar in February of 2023</a> and was the biggest upgrade to the part since 2016 as Dallara was able to improve their Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools and design a longer part that could reduce impact to the driver as noted by Tino Belli, director of aerodynamic development for INDYCAR at the time.</p><p>&ldquo;The whole concept is to try and bring the peak G's down, make them even lower and even spread the crush over a longer distance. This attenuator is longer than the one we have now. Dallara's FEA &ndash; Final Element Analysis &ndash; of crushing structures has got much better over the years, so they were able to model it much better virtually before we took it to an impact test.&rdquo;</p><p>The earliest batch of those rear attenuators that was released to start the 2023 season looked different than what we see today at Indianapolis as the smoothed panels in question for the Team Penske penalties did not exist yet.&nbsp;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/attenuatorupdate1.jpg" alt="Dallara IndyCar bulletin concerning the required modification for the rear attenuator for the Indy cars, 2023." width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Dallara IndyCar bulletin concerning the required modification for the rear attenuator for the Indy cars, 2023.</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Dallara</p><p>The attenuators went through a number of updates during the 2023 and 2024 seasons with the first mandatory update coming in May of 2023 that required teams to return attenuators to Dallara in order to strengthen them internally after issues in races early on in the season.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/attenuatorupdate2.jpg" alt="Dallara updated bulletin for IndyCar regarding mandated Indy 500 rear attenuator modification, 2023" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Dallara updated bulletin for IndyCar regarding mandated Indy 500 rear attenuator modification, 2023</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Dallara</p><p>Another bulletin was released just a couple of weeks later and instructed teams to remove the new attenuator and revert to the 2022 version at the direction of IndyCar for the 2023 Indy 500. Teams were instructed to modify these older attenuators in order to fit mounting parts from the newer version.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/attenuatorupdate2024.jpg" alt="Another bulletin from Dallara issued in 2024 on mandatory modifications needed for the rear attenuator" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Another bulletin from Dallara issued in 2024 on mandatory modifications needed for the rear attenuator</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Dallara</p><p>The new version of the attenuator saw its biggest change at the start of the 2024 season as a mandatory update required panels to be bonded internally and externally in order to make the attenuator stronger based on FEA analysis. The bonded panels on the outside that are in question in the current Team Penske penalties make their first appearance here as attenuators are sent back to Dallara in order to have those panels added.</p><p>Prior to this update the attenuators were one smooth piece, but now these carbon panels are glued to the outside in order to improve strength of the overall piece. The illustration above shows what the attenuators looked like prior to the start of the 2024 season and also highlights the new external panels in the illustration in blue.</p><h2>What happened at Team Penske</h2><p>According to multiple sources that aren&rsquo;t authorized to speak publicly, Team Penske started receiving these updated attenuators back from Dallara in early 2024 and members of leadership were not pleased with the aesthetics of the new glued-on panels as they showed a bright glue line that stood out and with a large raised edge. A member of the technical leadership is rumored to have instructed members of their team to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; the edges on the pieces in order to make the bright glue stand out less so these technicians applied a dark compound to the edges and smoothed them out.</p><p>Once these attenuators were modified, they were cleaned up and coated with sealer - per the standard procedure for many carbon fiber parts at Penske - and placed into their parts rotation to be installed on the cars to start the 2024 season.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/mclaughlinpole2024.jpg" alt="Scott McLaughlin with his P1 award for starting pole for the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500, 2024" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">Scott McLaughlin with his P1 award for starting pole for the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500, 2024</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment, Chris Jones</p><h2>How long has Penske been using the modified attenuators?</h2><p>Based on discussions with a variety of industry figures and Team Penske personnel, these modified attenuators have been in use for well over a year. We dug through the IndyCar photo archives and were able to find an easy example of a modified attenuator on the back of the pole winning car of Scott McLaughlin at the 2024 Indy 500 as seen below.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/mclaughlinpole2024closeup.jpg" alt="A close-up of Scott McLaughlin's rear attenuator from the photo above taken after he earned pole for the 2024 Indy 500. " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy"> <p class="title">A close-up of Scott McLaughlin's rear attenuator from the photo above taken after he earned pole for the 2024 Indy 500.</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment, Chris Jones</p><p>We&rsquo;ve slightly zoomed into the area in question and it is clearly visible that there is a smoothed area from the rear edge of the bonded panels to the main attenuator assembly. Additional digging shows that the modified attenuator appears at a variety of tracks on the Team Penske cars as we can see in the photos linked below which show a similarly modified attenuator on the back of the No. 2 of Josef Newgarden after a crash at Road America: <a href="https://x.com/FormulaIndy/status/1800210075279348002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://x.com/FormulaIndy/status/1800210075279348002</a></p><p>Industry members have spotted the same modified pieces at a variety of tracks in 2024 including on the back of the Indy 500 winning car of Newgarden which now sits at the museum at Indianapolis Motor Speedway where multiple have gone over in order to document the piece that was installed on the back of it.</p><h2>Where did IndyCar's technical inspection fail?</h2><p>The fact that Team Penske has been running modified attenuators since last season, but has only been penalized now, brings the IndyCar technical inspection process into question. How did these parts get missed by technical inspectors for so long if they were so blatantly illegal? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epHC4nVF9ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndyCar Technical Director Kevin "Rocket" Blanch spoke to media at Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> after the No. 2 and No. 12 cars were pulled out of line.</p><p>"Well there was a body fit violation on that rear attenuator so as quick as this process happens we ran them through tech, we got everybody in line and then right near the end or prior to qualifying they decided they would just pull out of line.&rdquo;</p><p>Blanch did not elaborate on their discovery, but according to reports from the track, the No. 12 car was sent to pit lane after passing through technical inspection, but the No. 2 car was eventually stopped for the modified attenuator. At that point, the No. 12 car was rechecked and found to have a similarly modified part. Team Penske technicians decided to attempt to clean up the parts to bring them back to the original specification, but IndyCar technical inspectors did not approve of that work as it is outside of the allowed changes once you are past technical inspection and in line to qualify. Rule 8.5.6 states: &ldquo;While the Car is in the Qualifications line, an Entrant&rsquo;s representatives may make front / rear wing angle, endplate angle and Tire pressure adjustments only. The Car must be moved as the Qualifications line progresses. A Car must not leave the Qualifications line without the approval of INDYCAR.&rdquo;</p><p>According to multiple sources in the IndyCar paddock, the only reason that the modifications were discovered at this specific event was due to reports from other competitors to the IndyCar technical department urging them to check the Team Penske cars. This shows a failure of the technical inspection process as the parts have gone through over a season's worth of technical inspections without ever being discovered until it was pointed out by a competing team.</p><h2>Did Team Penske gain an advantage from the modified parts?</h2><p>Smoothing out bodywork on a race car will often lead to speed as it can allow air to flow in a smoother manner over the car and reduce drag so the first assumption is that a smoothed out attenuator could be a performance gain but discussions with industry experts prove otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussions with engineers, body fit specialists, and drivers all led to the conclusion that there isn&rsquo;t laminar flow across the sides of the rear attenuator which means that the airflow over the car isn&rsquo;t close enough to the side of that attenuator for a rough step or smoothed out transition on those pieces to make a difference to the airflow coming off the back of the car. The fact that the modified attenuators were found on road courses as shown in the images above also appears to corroborate these theories since the modified parts were installed outside of ovals where drag isn&rsquo;t a focus as much as we see it at places like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p><h2>Was Team Penske penalized too harshly?</h2><p>The cars of Josef Newgarden and Will Power were initially pulled from the pole qualifying session and allowed to retain their position in the Fast 12, but after additional evaluation by IndyCar officials, they were sent to the back of the field and will now start 32nd and 33rd. <a href="https://epaddock.indycar.com/docs/default-source/rules-regulations-and-policies/indycar-rulebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Based on the IndyCar rule book</a> these penalties were likely too harsh as rule 8.5.13.1.7 states that &ldquo;The results of Day 1 Qualifications when thirty-four (34) or more Cars have entered the event shall determine: 8.5.13.1.7.1 Positions one (1) through twelve (12) have secured a starting position and will participate in the &ldquo;Top 12&rdquo; group on Day 2.&rdquo;</p><p>Additionally rule 8.5.13.2.6.5 states that &ldquo;Any Cars not able to begin or complete a required Qualifications attempt shall be ranked at the rear of the &ldquo;Top 12&rdquo; group in order of Day 1&rsquo;s Qualifications times.&rdquo;</p><p>Based on the rules above, the No. 2 and No. 12 cars had secured their way into the Top 12 as soon as the scoring sheet from the first day of qualifications was signed, so the strongest penalty they should have received was to be scored 11th and 12th based on the wording of the rule book. IndyCar officials used their discretion in order to go above and beyond what is explicitly written in the rule book, likely due to the nature of the prominence of the race and the point at which these items were discovered.</p><h2>Did Team Penske violate the rules?</h2><p>IndyCar technical inspection may have failed to discover the modified parts for months and likely penalized the two Team Penske entries a bit too harshly. Looking closely at the wording in the rule book, the parts were indeed not up to the listed specifications.&nbsp;</p><p>Rule 14.7.8.16.1 has a very explicit list of parts that can be modified an states that "The following parts may be blended to reduce uneven surfaces and gaps. Hard edges may be tapered or blended. These parts must remain separate parts and there must be a distinct joint line defining each part from its mounting surface or part(s). They must detach from their mating part(s) with the removal of the Tridairs or bolts. All intended shapes and radii must remain as designed. No tongue-and-groove, dovetail, or other types of body fitting will be permitted. Extra fasteners are permitted."</p><p>The listing of that rule has sixteen lines worth of parts that are allowed to be modified and the rear attenuator is not on that list, which means that Team Penske violated this rule when they smoothed the transition on the rear attenuator.</p><p>The best case scenario for enforcing this rule would have been for IndyCar officials to catch the changes when they first appeared on track last season and penalize them with a monetary or points fine at that time similar to what we see for <a href="https://www.indycar.com/news/2025/03/03-28-thermal-83-penalty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prema's recent penalty</a> for modifying a spec part. Since this modified part was missed for so long and only discovered at IMS this week, IndyCar technical officials also had the option to tell Team Penske to swap the parts for conforming ones during any of the earlier technical inspections during the week. Unfortunately it appears that the parts were not discovered until competing teams raised alarms with IndyCar technical inspectors so the situation reached a bad scenario that was made even worse by Team Penske technicians attempting to return the parts to original spec.</p><h2>Why did McLaughlin's car not get penalized?</h2><p>The No. 3 car of Scott McLaughlin was the only car that escaped penalties this week and that is due to the fact that it had an unmodified rear attenuator as confirmed by IndyCar after they seized the parts from his original Indy 500 car which was involved in a crash. According to internal sources at Team Penske that are not authorized to speak publicly, the No. 3 car had an attenuator from the latest batch that had come from Dallara and no modifications were made to it as technical leadership was pleased with the fitment of the externally attached panels and did not see unsightly glue on the edges so technicians made no changes to those parts.</p><p>The No. 2 and No. 12 cars were using attenuators that were from an earlier batch and had been cleaned up and resealed and then put back into service after use in previous races. Attenuators don&rsquo;t typically get removed from services unless there is crash damage to the car that may compromise them so it is not surprising to see them cleaned up and reused multiple times.</p><p>Once the modified attenuators were identified and banned, Team Penske pulled additional attenuators from the latest batch that they received from Dallara and installed them on the No. 2 and No. 12 cars.</p><h2>Other penalties</h2><p>Many have called for additional penalties such as removing the cars from the race or removing past wins that may have involved those parts, and my belief is that those calls go way too far &mdash; much like moving the entries to 32nd and 33rd went too far since the results have been signed off. Especially because the cars used in those races are no longer available to be checked.</p><h2>What IndyCar should do in the future...</h2><p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that one of the biggest stories of the week is focused on a part that was likely modified for aesthetic purposes but Team Penske violated an explicit rule from the IndyCar rule book and even though they may not see a performance advantage from it, they still made changes to a single-source part. Team Penske representatives should have presented the parts to IndyCar officials if they wished to modify them and gotten approval before doing so.</p><p>IndyCar technical inspectors also bear some responsibility in this whole scandal because they missed these modifications for over a year and only penalized Team Penske after competing teams raised alarms during the biggest race of the year. Technical inspection procedures should be evaluated for the future and they should consider introducing digital imaging of bodywork as seen in other major series like IMSA and NASCAR which can quickly catch any body part that might be out of spec. IndyCar should also consider implementing a parts repair portal similar to what NASCAR has done in order to streamline approvals for any repairs or modification to single source parts.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/indycar-president-qualifying-scandal-devastating-roger-penske/10724537/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0rGX1Zq2/s2/indycar-president-doug-boles.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">IndyCar president says qualifying scandal is "devastating" to Roger Penske</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/will-power-and-josef-newgarden-will-start-last-in-indy-500/10724487/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/Y99kqgXY/s2/josef-newgarden-team-penske.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Penske cars penalized, sent to back of grid for Indy 500</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/the-complete-starting-grid-for-the-109th-running-of-the-indianapolis-500/10724305/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQRKj1Y/s2/robert-shwartzman-prema-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">The complete starting grid for the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Antonelli "needs to learn to say no" after draining Imola F1 home race ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> Formula 1 rookie <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/andrea-kimi-antonelli/953412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrea Kimi Antonelli</a> admitted the buzz around his Imola homecoming weekend left him short on energy as he suffered a tricky event.</p><p>Antonelli's first grand prix start on Italian soil - just down the road from his native city of Bologna - did not turn out the way he or Mercedes had in mind, with Antonelli struggling for confidence in the car on Saturday before he and team-mate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> battled with excessive tyre overheating in the race.</p><p>Russell salvaged seventh, while Antonelli was initially able to keep <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> at bay during the first stint but ended up retiring with a throttle issue.</p><p>It was an anticlimax for Antonelli after a huge build-up to the race, which started by celebrating Bologna FC's domestic cup success and involved Antonelli inviting all of his classmates to the paddock. Antonelli was also seen going out of his way to make time for fans in the paddock, handing out photographs and taking selfies.</p><p>It was a memorable weekend for Antonelli, which he understandably tried to savour. But, coming just seven races into his fledgling F1 career, the 18-year-old also felt that he has yet to master how to manage all the attention, admitting the whole experience left him lacking energy inside the cockpit.</p><p>"Overall, I think the weekend was probably the worst in terms of performance, so that's why I'll try to recover well and be back stronger in Monaco," Antonelli said.</p><p>"I absolutely love the support of the fans. I just think on my side I didn't manage the energy that well, and that compromised definitely the performance on track. I could feel it. I was not as relaxed, I was a bit more tense while driving.</p><p>"So, ahead of the next home race, it was a really good lesson. But now we focus on Monaco, because it's going to be important to be on top of the game."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99kqlqY/s1000/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-andrea-.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>Antonelli also acknowledged that perhaps he needs to be a bit more selective in a race weekend with how he invests his time and energy. "I need to learn as well sometimes to say no and take a bit more time for myself," he added.</p><p>Team representative Bradley Lord acknowledged that both Mercedes and Antonelli will be taking on board lessons from the Imola weekend as the squad balances out Antonelli's schedule during his rookie campaign.</p><p>"For all of us, and for Kimi, the highest priority first and foremost is performance," Lord said when asked by Motorsport.com how challenging it was to manage the hype around its latest star.</p><p>"We knew this would be a big weekend and there's been a lot of attention. I think within the team we've seen him as focused as ever and concentrated. But, obviously, experiencing all of this for the first time, all the things you can control but also all the things you can't control, is a new phenomenon.</p><p>"We've got to view it as a learning experience, understand what were the moments that lifted him and gave him energy, and which bits potentially felt like overload. And then we'll adapt for both busy race weekends and particularly for the next home race in Italy in September as we go forward."</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ How ex-F1 racer Rubens Barrichello is still winning races at 52 ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Former Formula 1 driver <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/rubens-barrichello/64/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rubens Barrichello</a> won both races of the NASCAR Brazil Interlagos round last weekend. His victories came more than 13 years after <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/rubens-barrichello-f1-career-stats/4789843/" target="_self" rel="noopener">his retirement from F1</a> and marked a return to the top spot of the podium at Interlagos for the first time since 1990 when he competed in South American Formula 3.</p><p>&ldquo;When I stopped racing in Formula 1, I was 39 years old,&rdquo; said Barrichello.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard some people saying that I had already shown everything I had to show. And, for me, that showed that people didn't know me.&rdquo;</p><p>Barrichello entered his debut season in NASCAR Brazil in 2025, and won both races when the series stopped off at Interlagos this weekend. The Ferrari and BrawnGP icon triumphed in NASCAR Brazil's third round, getting his first victory on Saturday and following it with a win in Sunday&rsquo;s main race.</p><p>&ldquo;Interlagos, for me, is a joy,&rdquo; Barrichello said.</p><p>&ldquo;I've been driving here since 1990, when I won the race. The tow here [in this championship] has a big impact. Roger Penske couldn't see the race [because of the 2025 Indy 500 qualifying], otherwise he'd call me to race on a little oval. Stay tuned, Mr. Penske!"</p><p>After retiring from F1 in 2011, the Brazilian racer had a spell in IndyCar, followed by stints in stock cars and endurance racers. Barichello now races in Stock Car Pro and NASCAR Brazil, and got his last title in the former in 2022 after clinching his first championship win in Stock Car Pro back in 2014.</p><p>The last two Stock Car Pro years, though, were difficult for him: he was 7th in 2023 and just 14th in 2024. Now, at 52, the former F1 driver is turning around his seasons following a difficult start to 2025.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeWLvM2/s1000/rubens-barrichello-brawn-gp-bg-1.jpg" alt="Rubens Barrichello, Brawn GP BGP001 Mercedes battles with Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren MP4-24 Mercedes" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Rubens Barrichello, Brawn GP BGP001 Mercedes battles with Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren MP4-24 Mercedes</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Charles Coates / Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is that it's a great joy to be able to fight with all your strength for a victory you've always dreamed of, and this weekend it came in double doses,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>"We saw [Nico] Rosberg, for example, who was a champion and retired. But I really like what I do, it's a gift, it is with gratitude that I compete, battling younger and experienced drivers. I am a very grateful person for all the situations.</p><p>&ldquo;When Thiago [Marques, NASCAR Brazil CEO] and Maur&iacute;cio [Ferreira, team principal] from Full Time Team showed me the perspective [for NASCAR Brazil], I only had a problem with dates, because there are some rounds that I can't race. For example, I won't race the next NASCAR round because I have to be at Le Mans.&rdquo;</p><p>Barrichello will not race in Le Mans next month, but instead has sponsorship ties to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/stock-car-pro/news/rubens-barrichello-son-stock-car/6624406/" target="_self" rel="noopener">the event that his son, Eduardo Barrichello</a>, will contest with the Racing Spirit of Leman GT3 team in World Endurance Championship.</p><p>&ldquo;I'll take my helmet and if something happens...&rdquo; the Brazilian said.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, when they [Marques and Ferreira] showed me what we could do, it didn't take long for us to decide that I would race [in NASCAR Brazil].</p><p>&ldquo;The love I have for my profession, along with gratitude, make me a balanced person.</p><p>&ldquo;What got worse for &lsquo;Rubinho?&rsquo; My eyesight. I'm getting older, my eyesight gets worse, but you adapt to it and everything is fine."&nbsp;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/helio-castroneves-joins-barrichello-massa-in-the-2025-brazilian-stock-car-grid/10717995/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0mbBAb52/s2/helio-castroneves-meyer-shank-.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Helio Castroneves joins Barrichello, Massa in the 2025 Brazilian Stock Car grid</a><p>Barrichello will celebrate his 53rd birthday on Friday 23 May, with track action in the Stock Car Pro Series' Cascavel round, where he will keep living up to his already incredible &ndash; and passionate &ndash; motorsport journey.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Rinus Veekay: "Penske cars should have gone to the last-chance qualifier for Indy 500” ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/rinus-veekay/831560/">Rinus VeeKay</a> barely made it to the 109th Indianapolis 500 after a nerve-racking last-chance qualifier. The Dutchman beat his rookie Dale Coyne Racing teammate, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jacob-abel/950543/">Jacob Abel</a>, to claim the final spot on the grid for Sunday's May 25 race.</p><p>Perhaps that is why Veekay seemed upset when it was announced that the No. 2 Team Penske Chevrolet of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/14914/">Josef Newgarden</a> and the No. 12 Chevrolet of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/will-power/4712/">Will Power</a> were sent to the back of the field after it was determined that there was an illegal modification to the rear attenuator of both cars during Sunday's Fast 12 qualifying.</p><p>During a press conference held Monday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IndyCar and IMS track <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/indycar-president-qualifying-scandal-devastating-roger-penske/10724537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president Doug Boles explained why Newgarden and Power should be allowed to participate in the race</a> instead of being pushed out, which would allow Abel, whose car was legal all week, to race.</p><p>&ldquo;Transparently, the 33 fastest cars are in the Indianapolis 500. On Saturday all the cars passed tech. There was not a reason to look at those cars. They got through the cars, so on Saturday that qualification attempt should stand as far as I'm concerned,&rdquo; he stated.</p><p>Veekay was not satisfied with this response when he addressed the situation at a later press conference following Monday&rsquo;s drafting practice at Indianapolis.</p><p>"I mean, the cars went through tech several times last week. It was only discovered at that point. I would have thought it was fair if they had to go to the last-chance qualifier and deserved to fight their way into the field. It's an even more unfortunate situation for Jacob now,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Furthermore, Veekay, who is preparing for his sixth Indy 500, said he doesn&rsquo;t know how Team Penske could justify modifying the rear attenuators on their cars. However, he was able to find some humor in the circumstances.</p><p>"Of course, what they did was wrong. Yeah, I'm not totally sure how to justify the situation. It's kind of a weird situation. You don't see this every year.&rdquo;</p><p>"If you had told me a week ago that I'd be starting on the same row as two Penskes, I would have been very happy", he said with a smile. "Unfortunately, we're at the tail end of the field."</p><h2>Castroneves doesn&rsquo;t think it is &ldquo;a big deal&rdquo;</h2><p>Someone who did stand up for Team Penske on Monday was former teammate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/helio-castroneves/439/">Helio Castroneves</a>, who has been affiliated with the organization for a long time, winning three of his four Indianapolis 500.</p><p>The Brazilian had already defended Team Penske following a double disqualification for the use of an illegal push-to-pass system at St. Petersburg last year.</p><p>When asked about his position this time around, he answered: "Same. I believe they did something to look good. I don't think that little lip is going to make them three miles an hour faster, to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>Earlier, Boles said that the situation is "devastating" for team and IndyCar owner Roger Penske. Castroneves echoed this sentiment when talking about his former boss.</p><p>"I know how Roger operates. He wants everything to be beautiful, perfect, and shiny. I believe it was a mistake to touch an area they're not supposed to," he said.</p><p>Castroneves is an involved party because he is going to take part in the race, trying to win a record-breaking fifth Indy 500 with Meyer Shank Racing. He was adamant that Team Penske gained no advantage by doing this and saw no reason to make a big deal out of it.</p><p>&ldquo;In the rule book, they're not supposed to touch. I believe what the series is doing is right. But they don't need anything like that to go fast. Yeah, no, I don't see this as a situation that people are creating and making a big deal."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/will-power-and-josef-newgarden-will-start-last-in-indy-500/10724487/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/Y99kqgXY/s2/josef-newgarden-team-penske.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Penske cars penalized, sent to back of grid for Indy 500</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/indycar-president-qualifying-scandal-devastating-roger-penske/10724537/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0rGX1Zq2/s2/indycar-president-doug-boles.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">IndyCar president says qualifying scandal is "devastating" to Roger Penske</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ How Pirelli's controversial new tyre will shape the Monaco GP and beyond ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>On-track overtaking in Monaco is a rare commodity &ndash; drivers were complaining about the narrowness of the streets when Tazio Nuvolari was in his pomp.</p><p>Indeed, we reckon the last time the world&rsquo;s greatest drivers graced the principality with a genuine pass for the lead on anything other than the first lap was in 1985, when Michele Alboreto elbowed his way past Alain Prost at Sainte Devote at the beginning of lap 24. Pit strategy and incidents account for most changes of position here.</p><p>Last year, a red flag after a three-car shunt on the opening tour enabled the entire field to perform the required change from one tyre compound to another during the hiatus. The result was a processional tyre-management plod in which the points-paying positions worked out in grid order.</p><p>&ldquo;I think at one point we were going slower than Formula 2,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>, who finished second to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/109611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>.</p><p>Nobody wanted to pit again and lose track position so, even though the field was circulating at a reduced pace, there was very little overtaking attempted because tyre management took priority. In February, the FIA&rsquo;s World Motor Sport Council <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-two-pitstop-strategy-monaco-gp/10698674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubber-stamped a proposal from F1&rsquo;s stakeholders to require all drivers to use at least three sets of tyres in the Monaco race</a>, effectively making it a two-stopper at minimum.</p><p>This is a sticking-plaster solution at best, and not one that will be applied to other races since the likelihood is that teams would simply converge around the same pitstop timing. For there to be strategic variety, a number of different options with potential upsides have to be on the table &ndash; and that is why Pirelli has such high hopes for the new C6 tyre, created with street circuits like Monaco in mind but deployed for the first time at Imola last weekend.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/254MEXx0/s1000/oscar-piastri-mclaren.jpg" alt="Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>At the moment, the selection of three different dry-weather compounds Pirelli brings to each event is drawn from adjacent members of what was, until last weekend, a five-compound family. If the C6 can be rolled out at more grand prix weekends than originally intended, it opens the possibility of &lsquo;skipping&rsquo; compounds so there is a bigger performance differential between them.</p><p>&ldquo;Teams always find a way to apply a strategy on one stop,&rdquo; said Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola last weekend. &ldquo;We are trying to push them to have a two-stop strategy because it's better, it's more action, more unpredictability, and better races.</p><p>&ldquo;But, with the three compounds that are so close, they always try to use the hard and the medium to move to a one-stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Compounds being too similar is an issue that has cropped up before, but has become more of a factor this year after Pirelli made adjustments to make them more resilient &ndash; because drivers demanded to have tyres they could push on for longer. This has led to fewer races with offset strategies where drivers on fresher tyres at the end of a race chase down those who have opted to stick it out on older ones.</p><p>Since the compounds are homologated and cannot be changed in-season, the only option is to find other ways to use the ones that already exist. Pirelli plans to run fresh simulations for the coming races based on data gathered on the latest rubber during the opening rounds.</p><p>This, reckons Isola, will enable Pirelli to &ldquo;see if there is any solution, like, to skip one level, to have a hard that is harder &ndash; so if you want to use the hard you are penalised by the lap time. You can push but it's slower.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2eADGKl2/s1000/mario-isola-racing-manager-pir.jpg" alt="Mario Isola, Racing Manager, Pirelli Motorsport, on the grid" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Mario Isola, Racing Manager, Pirelli Motorsport, on the grid</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images</p><p>&ldquo;And we need to understand if, with this system, we encourage some of them to move to a soft-medium choice for the race &ndash; that is a two-stop race in this case, and if you want to stay on one-stop medium-hard your pace is lower than the other.&rdquo;</p><p>Where the C6 comes in, and why Pirelli wanted to try it at Imola as well, is to facilitate that spread of performance. When the new compound was first mooted as an even softer option than the existing C6, it was expected to be used only in Monaco and perhaps Las Vegas &ndash; a faster street circuit but one with lower ambient temperatures since the race takes place at night. Now, Pirelli is bringing it to Canada and talking about Baku, Singapore and even Mexico.</p><p>But first it needed to be tested in race conditions at a venue other than Monaco, for reasons Pirelli chief engineer Simone Berra explained last weekend.</p><p>&ldquo;Collecting the information for the C6 in Monaco was not really significant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Monaco is a particular circuit, you can have graining just because of the smooth Tarmac and low-speed corners and all these kinds of situations.</p><p>&ldquo;For us it's really important to collect data here [Imola] for the C6, also for the selection for the second part of the season.&rdquo;</p><p>Imola was a proof of concept to see if the C6 could handle corners that put more energy through the tyre. The key lesson so far seems to be that it has a sharp performance peak so, at a circuit like Imola with fast, flowing corners, thermal stresses build up quickly and it can slip out of its optimal performance &lsquo;window&rsquo;, even over the course of one lap.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2548wNQ0/s1000/sergio-perez-red-bull-racing-r.jpg" alt="Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB20, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, in the queue to leave the pits" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB20, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB20, in the queue to leave the pits</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images</p><p>The medium-compound tyre then became theoretically the better qualifying choice, but using it required earmarking sets for the race. While this is a strategic element that potentially adds interest, it's understood that the stakeholders&rsquo; preferred route is to have differentiation between compounds and potential race pace rather than this kind of &lsquo;jeopardy&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Looking at the result here [Imola],&rdquo; said Berra, &ldquo;we can, let's say, evaluate better if it's too risky or not really. For example, for Singapore we are thinking about bringing the C6, and also starting to jump compounds.</p><p>&ldquo;So for example, bringing C2, C4, C6 at some circuits to try something different, or C3, C4 and C6, to try to differentiate strategic approaches.&rdquo;</p><p>For this, the C6 will have to be at the very least a good qualifying tyre. But at least it&rsquo;s been more successful already than a previous attempt to add a softer step to the tyre portfolio.</p><p>Back in 2018, under a different naming regime, Pirelli introduced a &lsquo;hypersoft&rsquo; tyre in Monaco, and the unintended consequence was a largely processional race in which drivers tiptoed round during their stint on the new compound. Having a minimum of two stops will at least mean this year&rsquo;s race won&rsquo;t pan out exactly the same way.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/what-happened-mclaren-pace-advantage-red-bull-f1-imola-gp/10724497/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6VRzVy46/s2/oscar-piastri-mclaren-max-vers-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">What happened to McLaren's pace advantage on Red Bull at F1 Imola GP?</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Hyundai returned to form in Portugal but it will postpone any decision to run a fourth car until it is happy with its upgraded World Rally Championship challenger&rsquo;s performance.</p><p>The South Korean marque bounced back from its crushing Canary Islands defeat last month by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/wrc-portugal-sebastien-ogier-claims-record-extending-win/10724085/" target="_self" rel="noopener">taking the fight to Toyota in Portugal last weekend</a>.</p><p>Hyundai appeared to have the edge on Toyota on gravel in what was the upgraded i20 N&rsquo;s first event on the loose surface this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/ott-tanak/16459/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ott Tanak</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/adrien-fourmaux/841702/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adrien Fourmaux</a> topped the standings on Friday before the latter suffered a suspension failure. Tanak won 12 of the 24 stages to finish second but would have most likely won the rally had he avoided a <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/sudden-failure-forces-fourmaux-out-of-rally-portugal-victory-fight/10723324/" target="_self" rel="noopener">power steering failure on Saturday</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;This weekend has been a return to the form we expect of ourselves,&rdquo; said Hyundai Motorsport president and team principal Cyril Abiteboul.</p><p>&ldquo;We have been incredibly competitive throughout the event, with Ott expertly spearheading the charge. He has been impeccable, leading for 15 stages and taking 12 wins; he was the man to beat out there.</p><p>&ldquo;We regret that Ott&rsquo;s reliability issue has handed the victory to Toyota, but everyone in the team should be proud of their efforts this weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>Hyundai has toyed with the prospect of running a fourth car and it appears there is still a chance it could decide to run an extra car, in addition to its three 2025 full-time entries driven by world champion <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/thierry-neuville/14925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thierry Neuville</a>, Tanak and Fourmaux.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2GzXgQQ0/s1000/ott-tanak-martin-jarveoja-hyun.jpg" alt="Ott T&auml;nak, Martin J&auml;rveoja, Hyundai World Rally Team Hyundai i20 N Rally1" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Ott T&auml;nak, Martin J&auml;rveoja, Hyundai World Rally Team Hyundai i20 N Rally1</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>This year Hyundai has come up against an expanded Toyota line-up with the Japanese brand fielding five cars in three of the five events to date. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/sami-pajari/955314/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sami Pajari</a> isn&rsquo;t contributing to Toyota&rsquo;s manufacturer points but part-time driver Sebastien Ogier has been registered to score in his three rounds to date, helping the marque move into a 55-point lead in the manufacturers' standings.</p><p>Abiteboul has refused to rule out adding an extra Rally1 car this year for long-term Hyundai servant <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/daniel-sordo/6573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dani Sordo</a>, who is competing for Hyundai Portugal in the Portuguese national championship. Sordo was present at last weekend&rsquo;s Rally Portugal, which also acted as a round for the national series.</p><p>Sordo&rsquo;s most recent WRC Rally1 return was last year&rsquo;s Acropolis Rally, where the 42-year-old finished second behind Neuville. There had been suggestions Sordo could have made a return in Sardinia next month although his name was absent from the entry list.</p><p>&ldquo;There is still a chance for a fourth car,&rdquo; said Abiteboul during Rally Portugal.</p><p>&ldquo;The Canary Islands has been a shock to the system and when there is a shock to the system what you need to do is regroup and think and put on standby some of the action we had planned, and in particular think about the best way to use the financial resources you have available.</p><p>&ldquo;Running a fourth car needs more resources in terms of staff, financial resources and logistics. After Canary Islands, was running a fourth car the best way to use resources, maybe, maybe not?</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2QzVaZ3Y/s1000/cyril-abiteboul-team-principal.jpg" alt="Cyril Abiteboul, Team principal Hyundai World Rally Team" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Cyril Abiteboul, Team principal Hyundai World Rally Team</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Vincent Thuillier / Hyundai Motorsport</p><p>&ldquo;In any case we are postponing that decision until we have a bit of a clearer idea because, frankly, if you enter four uncompetitive cars it doesn&rsquo;t help your case.</p><p>&ldquo;The first thing is to understand our competitiveness level and anything we can do in the short term to make it better. Then, if you have the confidence, you can play tactics with a fourth car.</p><p>&ldquo;There is also the case that obviously with more cars you have more test days coming and therefore learn more about the Hankook tyres. We thought about that, but it is an expensive way to get access to more information about the tyres. We like to think we can get to the same result in a different way.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ FIA issued technical directives before Imola GP, but did they have any impact? ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>In the week leading up to the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the FIA clarified some aspects of the technical regulations through technical directives (TD) - which is a common procedure in itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Motorsport.com has learned that these were not actual changes to the regulations, but clarifications of what the rules specified and their intended purposes.</p><p>The first clarification involves materials used around the skid blocks and their mounting. This is an important aspect with the current ground-effect cars, as teams want to lower the ride height as much as possible, but the floor cannot be excessively worn, as teams still need to pass the FIA's technical inspection, which is measured at the skid blocks areas.</p><p>The second clarification is related to devices and ways of keeping the tyres as cool as possible, where the FIA in response to questions from another team has clarified which methods are not allowed.</p><h2>Did it have an effect?</h2><p>Regarding the latter, Red Bull has drawn attention to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> in recent weeks. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> told Dutch media during the Miami Grand Prix: "If you look at what McLaren is doing with the rear tyres, then we&rsquo;re all doing something wrong."</p><p>When McLaren missed out on victory at Imola, Christian Horner commented during his post-race media session: "We were sort of more surprised about McLaren's lack of performance."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0oOzy7a0/s1000/christian-horner-red-bull-raci.jpg" alt="Horner was surprised by McLaren's lack of race pace" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Horner was surprised by McLaren's lack of race pace</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images</p><p>Technical director Pierre Wache told media including Motorsport.com that Red Bull's upgrade step wasn't as significant as it seemed, and that McLaren wasn't as strong as he anticipated.</p><p>That said, McLaren immediately made clear that nothing had changed for the Woking squad. Team principal Andrea Stella already said during Friday's press conference that rivals are focusing on the wrong things: "I hope that in the future there will be more of these kinds of sagas because it means that our rivals keep focusing on the wrong things, and this is just good news for us. It&rsquo;s helping our quest."</p><p>The team claims that nothing has changed around the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, and other voices in the paddock share this view. Oscar Piastri's MCL39 was checked by the FIA after the Miami Grand Prix and found to be in order, which was confirmed with an FIA document on Thursday in Imola.</p><h2>Is Red Bull's progress track-specific? Barcelona an interesting test</h2><p>Verstappen was just as cautious about drawing far-reaching conclusions after the race that he won. The Dutchman believes that Red Bull's strength in Imola was to a large extent related to the track layout.</p><p>"I think it's very track specific," the world champion said. "I mean, every time that we have been really competitive, it&rsquo;s been high-speed tracks, high-speed corners.</p><p>"Of course, we brought upgrades. I think they worked, but Monaco is very different. It&rsquo;s not been our strongest track with the car that we have, so let's see how we are going to perform there."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YW78mKeY/s1000/lando-norris-mclaren-oscar-pia.jpg" alt="Verstappen isn't rushing to conclusions after Imola pace" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Verstappen isn't rushing to conclusions after Imola pace</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>It fits the pattern of the season so far, as Verstappen has also been competitive at Suzuka and Jeddah - two tracks with many high-speed corners.</p><p>Red Bull faced more problems on circuits with slow-speed corners, as seen clearly in Bahrain and Miami.</p><p>Monaco is atypical and not representative of what&rsquo;s to come, but the Spanish Grand Prix will be an interesting test - especially as the FIA will clamp down on flexi wings even further, the front wings in particular.</p> ]]>

His Alpine team and governing body the FIA have now also spoken out against the online abuse Tsunoda has received over the weekend from a small minority of fans.</p><p>"As an F1 team, we believe we are fortunate to be part of a global sport that evokes great passion and emotions, with an ever-growing community of fans who enthusiastically follow their favourite drivers' every move, whether it be a brave overtake on track or what style they are sporting when they arrive in the paddock," Alpine's statement read.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/24vxB5q6/s1000/yuki-tsunoda-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>"We encourage everyone to remember that behind the visor of these superhuman athletes there is a person, an individual with feelings, family, friends and loved ones.</p><p>"As a team, we cannot condone online abuse and urge all fans of this sport we love, to be kind and respectful."</p><p>FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who has commissioned a campaign to tackle online abuse, said: "Motorsport is built on competition, passion, and commitment, and every race drivers take to the track representing these values. That passion and excitement that we feel for our sport should unite us and never be twisted into abuse or hate.</p><p>"I stand in full support of Yuki Tsunoda and Franco Colapinto, and I thank them for speaking out against the growing issue of online abuse in motorsport."</p><p>Over the weekend, Alpine reserve driver <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jack-doohan/454760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Doohan</a> - who made way for Colapinto at Imola - also had to urge fans to stop harassing him and his family.</p><p>A social media&nbsp;parody account falsely portrayed his father Mick appearing to mock <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/massive-franco-colapinto-crash-red-flags-f1-imola-gp-qualifying-again/10723724/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Colapinto's qualifying crash</a>, which was spread by various news outlets and triggered the latest wave of abuse Doohan has received over the past five months.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ McLaren: Imola is a missed chance that goes beyond the strategy topic ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Imola Grand Prix leaves us with a key question that sums up a Formula 1 weekend that, after Friday&rsquo;s free practice sessions, had seemed already written. McLaren's MCL39 looked like the car to beat &mdash; setting the standard both in qualifying trim and race pace &mdash; while the RB21 once again struggled with the set-up issues that typically plague its opening day on track. Yet, the expected narrative was wrong.</p><p>A stellar <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> once again changed the course of the race, snatching victory from <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> in what can only be described as a missed opportunity for the Woking team.</p><p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Verstappen later referred to the race as a &ldquo;perfect execution&rdquo;, because something extraordinary was required to beat McLaren. From the start to the race strategy, including exploiting potential missteps from McLaren&rsquo;s pitwall, the Dutchman and his team delivered precisely that.</p><p>The turning point came right at the start: <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/analysis-verstappen-impressive-overtake-piastri-imola-f1-gp/10724412/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Verstappen&rsquo;s audacious overtake around the outside of the Tamburello chicane</a> reshaped the race entirely. Not only did it keep him out of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>&rsquo;s turbulent air, but it also gave him control of the pace. As seen in other races &mdash; Miami being a notable example &mdash; <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/red-bull-racing/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull</a>&nbsp;can keep up with rivals on fresh tires but, over longer stints, the car's vulnerabilities start to show. However, Imola told a more interesting story than it might first appear.</p><p>A significant portion of the gap Verstappen built over Piastri in the first stint came within the opening two laps, where he consistently pushed to extend his lead. But, looking more broadly, between laps three and nine the narrative changes. Lap times stabilized for both drivers, and Verstappen gained just two additional tenths, bringing his total advantage to just under two seconds.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 450pt;" border="0" width="450pt" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup><col style="width: 48pt;" span="4" width="64"> </colgroup><tbody><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt; width: 48pt;" width="64" height="20"><strong>Lap</strong></td><td style="width: 48pt;" width="64"><strong>Verstappen</strong></td><td style="width: 48pt;" width="64"><strong>Piastri</strong></td><td style="width: 48pt;" width="64"><strong>Difference</strong></td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">3</td><td>1m21.258s</td><td>1m21.345s</td><td>+0.087s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">4</td><td>1m21.218s</td><td>1m21.290s</td><td>+0.072s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">5</td><td>1m21.228s</td><td>1m21.096s</td><td>-0.132s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">6</td><td>1m20.977s</td><td>1m21.316s</td><td>+0.339s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">7</td><td>1m21.496s</td><td>1m21.407s</td><td>-0.089s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">8</td><td>1m21.206s</td><td>1m21.178s</td><td>-0.028s</td></tr><tr style="height: 15.0pt;"><td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">9</td><td>1m21.194s</td><td>1m21.168s</td><td>-0.026s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This was when the race began to shift. From lap 10 onward, Piastri&rsquo;s performance dropped off, his lap times increased by several tenths, while Verstappen&rsquo;s remained consistent. The advantage in some corners that had earned McLaren pole on Saturday - and helped in keeping pace in the first laps - faded from that point forward. This growing gap forced McLaren to consider a change in strategy. &ldquo;I think Oscar obviously pushed quite hard at the start, and you could see he was beginning to get a bit of graining on the front-right tire,&rdquo; Red Bull boss Christian Horner noted after the race.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RrQpJB0/s1000/oscar-piastri-mclaren-max-vers.jpg" alt="Verstappen pushed particularly hard on the first couple of laps to build a gap to Piastri" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Verstappen pushed particularly hard on the first couple of laps to build a gap to Piastri</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>Weather conditions also played a role: at the race start, track temperatures peaked at 45&deg;C, the highest of the weekend. When tires are pushed too aggressively early on when they are not ready, especially through high-energy corners like Piratella, where indeed McLaren was pushing to keep the pace, it can lead to a thermal imbalance, triggering graining. The softer the tyres, the more susceptible they are to this phenomenon.</p><p>Piastri&rsquo;s sudden drop in pace was not typical tire degradation due to wear, but rather a thermal issue. We have a hint also from <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a>: over the radio, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> was told that the tire removed during his first stop still had 70% of its tread left. This underscores how critical tire temperature management was, particularly on such a hot track. Front-end graining has long plagued McLaren more than other teams, and it&rsquo;s this issue that ultimately pushed the team to put Piastri on a two-stop strategy.</p><p>Although Andrea Stella later stated that McLaren had considered a different strategy to surprise Red Bull, the call was mainly reactive to Piastri&rsquo;s declining pace during that stint. Indeed, over the radio, the team asked the Australian whether he could keep pushing or if a pitstop was needed. McLaren acted on instinct, not to cover drivers like <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/109611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a>, who was not a threat, but because it simply lacked pace in that phase. The team opted to pit before the tires could stabilize and recover pace, hoping to shift the race towards the two stops.</p><p>However, switching to a two-stop effectively ended Piastri&rsquo;s chances of winning. Imola features one of the longest pitlanes on the calendar, with each stop costing around 28s. Add the risk of traffic and just one DRS zone, and overtaking becomes a major challenge, making a two-stop strategy unrewarding for frontrunners.</p><p>Before the VSC caused by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/esteban-ocon/19624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esteban Ocon</a>&rsquo;s retirement, Piastri had to overtake seven cars, those who stayed out with a one-stop strategy, which added nearly another second to his gap behind Verstappen. Even without the VSC, his hopes were already compromised, since Verstappen could have pitted and still rejoined in the lead, having only stopped once.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeB3VM2/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Red Bull's better tyre management enabled Verstappen to take advantage of the VSC" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Red Bull's better tyre management enabled Verstappen to take advantage of the VSC</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>&ldquo;In the first stint, even if the tires felt like they were degrading quickly, they still had more to give - that&rsquo;s why Lando, Max, and other drivers stuck with a one-stop strategy,&rdquo; Stella explained. Once the tyres had settled, as seen with Norris in the first stint, the pace began to pick up again.</p><p>While the first-lap overtake undoubtedly shaped the race, it wasn&rsquo;t the sole reason for Verstappen&rsquo;s win &mdash; especially considering McLaren couldn&rsquo;t play a two-versus-one strategy against Verstappen, with Norris further back. McLaren could have hoped to manage tire wear better, but even that was a long shot given the RB21&rsquo;s improved pace and the race neutralizations that allowed Verstappen to stop for fresh tires.</p><p>This is also why Red Bull remains cautious, avoiding overconfidence despite promising signs from its Imola updates, which helped increase the set-up window. The RB21 has shown flashes of pace in specific races before, only to struggle in the following contests, showing that it's really track-dependant, while generally McLaren has shown a greater spike in performance and more versatility.</p><p>Stella, meanwhile, remains optimistic heading into circuits with slower corners, where the MCL39 continues to be the reference point and generally has a bigger advantage: &ldquo;If you look at the aero maps of Miami and here, they&rsquo;re very different. We were competitive in Bahrain, China, Miami. But in fast corners, we don&rsquo;t have a particular advantage. And Red Bull has improved their car.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

An illegal modification to the rear attenuator where a part was filled in and smoothed over in an apparent rules breach. Originally, the cars were pulled out of line for Fast 12 qualifying and were set to start on Row 4, but that has since changed dramatically.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/penskes-modifications-arent-the-actual-problem-the-fact-that-no-one-caught-them-is/10724722/" target="_self" rel="noopener">And before we get into the press conference, if you're looking for more details on the modifications and how they went unnoticed for so long, read this explainer from Motorsport.com contributor Bozi Tatarevic:</a></p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/penskes-modifications-arent-the-actual-problem-the-fact-that-no-one-caught-them-is/10724722/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQR9WKY/s2/josef-newgarden-team-penske.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Penske&rsquo;s modifications aren&rsquo;t entirely the problem, the fact that no one caught them is</a><h2>Why McLaughlin wasn't penalized</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YpNRVGX0/s1000/scott-mclaughlin-team-penske.jpg" alt="Scott McLaughlin, Team Penske" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Scott McLaughlin, Team Penske</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>As for the third Penske car of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/scott-mclaughlin/18844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott McLaughlin</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/scott-mclaughlin-crash/10724205/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which was heavily damaged in an airborne practice crash</a>, series officials did look at the rear attenuator of the No. 3 as well. Speaking to the assembled media at the track, IndyCar and IMS track president Doug Boles explained why he was not penalized in the end.</p><p>"We do have the attenuators from all three of these cars," explained Boles. "The #3&nbsp;car attenuator from the crash with the crashed wing still attached to it was provided to us, and we still have it. That attenuator was not modified at all. So on Sunday, we can tell you by facts -- again, the lawyer in me -- that car was presented when it drove at least with an attenuator on the car that met all of the rules of the IndyCar Competition Rule Book. So the #3&nbsp;car will start in (the) 10th spot, which will be the last car in the Fast 12 that did not get removed to the back of the field. So the #3&nbsp;car will not have any additional penalties.</p><h2>Why Abel has no path into the Indy 500 field</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gpl1Gn0/s1000/jacob-abel-dale-coyne-racing.jpg" alt="Jacob Abel, Dale Coyne Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Jacob Abel, Dale Coyne Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>The other burning question surrounds <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jacob-abel/950543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Abel</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/jacob-abel-indy-500-qualifying-fails-to-make-race-teammate-veekay/10724250/" target="_self" rel="noopener">the only driver who failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500.</a> Some have argued that he should now have a place in the 33-car field and one of the Penske cars should be pushed out of the event instead. Boles disagrees.</p><p>"Transparently, the 33 fastest cars are in the Indianapolis 500," said Boles. "On Saturday all the cars passed tech. There was not a reason to look at those cars. They got through the cars, so on Saturday that qualification attempt should stand as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>"On Sunday is where we're talking about right now, the facts are that those cars did not meet to qualify in the 12. The rule says, if you get disqualified from the 12, you start 12th and 11th. We've gone one step further and put them in the back. Do I feel gutted for Jacob Abel? Absolutely. The guy is running our whole season. I know how important this race is to Dale Coyne. Dale Coyne and I have had arguments after arguments over whether we should guarantee starting spots at the Indianapolis 500. He and I are on opposite sides of that conversation, but in this instance, I don't think that the result for the 33 cars should be changed."</p><h2>Roger Penske's stance and involvement</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RrXMXo0/s1000/roger-penske-president-of-pens.jpg" alt="Roger Penske, President of Penske Motorsport" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Roger Penske, President of Penske Motorsport</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: FIAWEC - DPPI</p><p>This is also an awkward position for Roger Penske, who of course owns the cars driven by Newgarden and Power, but also runs IndyCar in its entirety. This is not the first a scandal involving the Penske cars has arisen since Roger took control of the series with the 2024 push-to-pass (P2P) controversy being another unfortunate highlight. So where does Roger stand on all of this?&nbsp;</p><p>"I've known&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;Penske for an awful long time, and I've gotten to know him really well since November 2019," said Boles. "I don't think&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;Penske understands some of the things that might be going on.</p><p>"I get the optics challenge, and it's definitely something we should think about. I mean, how do you manage the optics challenge? A lot of these challenges I think are -- while they roll up to&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;at the end of the day, I think they are certainly below him. There are things that happen that don't ever get to&nbsp;Roger.</p><p>"I can tell you that&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;Penske would not condone this. In fact, I had a chance to talk to&nbsp;Roger, and I can tell that this is devastating to him. Nothing means more to&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;Penske than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500. He certainly loves racing across the board. This is something that I think he's going to have to address at some point in time."</p><p>As for who made the final call to penalize Team Penske, Boles explained that it was a group of officials including himself and IndyCar CEO Mark Miles. However, he stressed that Roger Penske "was not involved" in the decision in any way.</p><p>"I didn't sleep at all last night," said Boles. "You probably can't tell, but I frankly didn't take a shower this morning. My hair is a mess. The first thing I did this morning was call Mark [Miles]. Mark basically said the same thing. The two of us sat down and started thinking through what is the appropriate thing to make sure that we're managing the integrity of the Indianapolis 500?"</p><h2>Cleaning up the confusing timeline of events</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YW78m5xY/s1000/josef-newgarden-team-penske.jpg" alt="Josef Newgarden, Team Penske" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Josef Newgarden, Team Penske</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>Boles also clarified the timeline of events, as there were some discrepancies over how this all unfolded. Boles confirmed that officials noticed that the attenuator on Power's car may have been modified as he went through tech, but they weren't completely sure. Power's car made it out to the pit lane, but as more cars went through, they noticed that Newgarden's attenuator was the only one altered like Power's. That's when alarm bells began to ring.</p><p>"At that point in time Kevin [Blanch, IndyCar technical director] said to the car chief of the #2 [Newgarden], who was standing with him, will you please call the car chief of the #12 car [Power] and tell him to move the car aside because that attenuator also is illegal," said Boles.</p><p>Boles further explained the events that followed as Penske suddenly started working on their cars in the pit lane, much to the objection of rival teams. "It is not unusual for -- it's not common, but it is not unusual for our technical team to find something on a teammate car and actually go out onto pit lane and inspect a car, a teammate's car, just to ensure that if they found something on one car, it's not on the other," explained Boles.</p><p>"So the tech team did the job as they were supposed to. Some confusion happened on pit lane, I think, when members of the 12 car I believe started to grind on the back of the attenuator where it had been modified, which then created -- I think some rumors came out of that, but that was really the reason we were trying to think through the facts of that position."</p><p>The Penske team was informed that they could still qualify, but they would likely be disqualified in post-qualifying inspection. "The team chose to pull out of line and take that option versus qualifying and being disqualified for sure as they went through the tech line."</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/tim-cindric-executives-ousted-by-penske-indycar-rules-breach/10724946/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Penske has since released three top executives as the fallout continues from this qualifying scandal.

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The third edition of the North Wilkesboro All-Star Race was a good one with a record number of lead changes and plenty of action from start to finish. The field of 23 included race winners from the previous year, former All-Star winners, and Cup champions. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/carson-hocevar/953387/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carson Hocevar</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/john-hunter-nemechek/20444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Hunter Nemechek</a> raced their way into the field via the Open while <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/noah-gragson/407569/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noah Gragson</a> claimed the final spot on the grid, via the Fan Vote.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/christopher-bell/16942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Bell</a> <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/christopher-bell-wins-nascar-all-star-race-thrilling-battle/10724279/" target="_self" rel="noopener">went on to win the race with an aggressive late-race pass for the lead</a> while <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/joey-logano/9725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joey Logano</a> finished second, failing to go back-to-back in the exhibition race.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let's take a look at the biggest winners and losers from the weekend...</p><h2>WINNER: North Wilkesboro proves it deserves a points race</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2GzXvNQ0/s1000/brad-keselowski-roush-fenway-k.jpg" alt="Brad Keselowski, Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing Ford" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Brad Keselowski, Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing Ford</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: David Jensen / Getty Images</p><p>The NASCAR All-Star Race at North Wilkesboro featured far better racing than the previous two years as the track begins to age. Perhaps the most exciting short track now on the schedule, the event featured 18 lead changes -- the most in All-Star Race history. Of the 23 starters, eight different drivers took a turn out front, and the closing laps showcased a thrilling three-way battle for the win. In fact, the race was good enough that many think the historic short track shouldn't just host the All-Star Race in the future, but actually deserves a points-paying date on the championship calendar.</p><h2>LOSER: The promoter's caution, and not just because <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/michael-waltrip/36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Waltrip</a> dropped the flag</h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You had one job, Mikey &#128514; <a href="https://twitter.com/MW55?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MW55</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASCAR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NASCAR</a> <a href="https://t.co/ozvynfyWCF">pic.twitter.com/ozvynfyWCF</a></p>&mdash; FOX: NASCAR (@NASCARONFOX) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARONFOX/status/1924280564720505048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>This was a controversial concept when first introduced and it was handled in a rather amusing, but honestly, corny way. 1996 All-Star Race winner Michael Waltrip ascended the flagstand, engaging with the crowd as we waited for him to throw the yellow at any point of his choosing, but before 30 laps to go. Just as this was unfolding, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/kyle-larson/17135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Larson</a> clobbered the wall and slowed down abruptly. Before a natural caution could occur, Waltrip quickly waved the yellow ... and then dropped it onto the actual race track as fireworks were launched into the air. It's a bit funny how the entire point of the yellow flag was to spice things up, but there was likely to be a natural caution anyway at that point. In the future, this 'gimmick' yellow probably isn't necessary and if NASCAR really wants to break up the action, just include a scheduled competition caution instead.</p><h2>WINNER: Bell for earning a big payday&nbsp;</h2><img draggable="false" alt="" loading="lazy"><p class="title">Watch: Christopher Bell: 'Absolutely incredible' to win All-Star Race</p><p>Bell i<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/christopher-bell-wins-nascar-all-star-race-thrilling-battle/10724279/" target="_self" rel="noopener">s an All-Star Race winner for the first time in his career.</a> He finished no higher than tenth in his previous four attempts, but Bell was fast all weekend at North Wilkesboro. He and the No. 20 team made the right call, pitting for fresh right-side tires and quickly finding a path through the cars that stayed out. He methodically worked his way around Logano for the race lead, rubbing fenders with him as he cleared the Penske driver. It was an exceptional drive for the win after a strong weekend overall for the <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/joe-gibbs-racing/80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Gibbs Racing</a> driver.</p><h2>LOSER: Logano for being sour over the way Bell raced him</h2><img draggable="false" alt="" loading="lazy"><p class="title">Watch: Logano on Bell: 'If I could've got to him, he was going around'</p><p>Logano was not happy after Sunday's race. He dominated until the late-race promoter's caution, choosing to stay out while Bell and several others came down pit road for fresh rubber. Bell fought his way around Logano, sliding him up the track with just ten laps to go. Logano, who has a reputation as one of the most aggressive drivers in the field, took issue with that, as well as the promoter's caution for setting up the sprint to the finish. Talking about Bell's move, he said:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/joey-logano-pissed-calls-out-gimmick-caution-bell-raced-him/10724286/" target="_self" rel="noopener">"I did all I could do to hold him off and he got under me and released the brake and gave me no option.

Undeterred, he marched forward from the rear of the field, reaching 11th before the promoter's caution. He stayed out and while most of the drivers who did that fell back, he was the only one who didn't lose any spots from his restart position. Chastain actually reached as high as second and was lurking just behind the battle for the lead, finishing third for his best result yet in the All-Star Race.</p><h2>LOSER: SVG and Preece for giving away transfer spots</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Yv87Pde0/s1000/shane-van-gisbergen-trackhouse.jpg" alt="Shane van Gisbergen, Trackhouse Racing Chevrolet" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Shane van Gisbergen, Trackhouse Racing Chevrolet</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: David Jensen / Getty Images</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/hocevar-nemechek-advance-all-star-race-gragson-fan-vote/10724252/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Both Shane van Gisbergen and Ryan Preece were in a great position to advance into the main event on Sunday night</a>. SVG dominated the first half of the race, but chose to take four tires while many of those around him made a two-tire stop. This was a critical mistake as SVG never recovered the lost track position, failing to make the show. Meanwhile, Preece put himself in a good spot as well, holding the final transfer spot for a late restart with better tires than the leader. And that's when he ran over the choose box, resulting in an end-of-line penalty that eliminated him from contention. In fairness to Preece, it was difficult to see and NASCAR chose to repaint it before the main event, but he was still the only driver to run over it in a devastating unfortunate error.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/christopher-bell-responds-to-logano-criticism-ive-seen-joey-do-much-worse-/10724303/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YBeB3pz2/s2/joey-logano-team-penske-ford-c.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Christopher Bell responds to Logano criticism: "I've seen Joey do much worse" </a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/joey-logano-pissed-calls-out-gimmick-caution-bell-raced-him/10724286/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0ZR91350/s2/joey-logano-team-penske-ford-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">"Pissed off" Joey Logano calls out Bell, 'gimmick' All-Star Race caution</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/christopher-bell-wins-nascar-all-star-race-thrilling-battle/10724279/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6gpl1on0/s2/christopher-bell-joe-gibbs-rac-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Christopher Bell wins NASCAR All-Star Race after contact-filled battle</a><p><iframe style="display: none;" title="Twitter settings iframe" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.2f70fb173b9000da126c79afe2098f02.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-thewall.motorsport.com" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p><iframe id="rufous-sandbox" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: none; width: 0px; height: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;" title="Twitter analytics iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Inside Carbone Beach: The most exclusive event on the F1 calendar ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Hours after clinching his first-ever Formula 1 victory, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/">Lando Norris</a> found himself exactly where any newly-minted race winner might hope to be: flanked by the likes of Travis Kelce while partying beneath the glittering chandeliers at Carbone Beach. The McLaren driver made a beeline for the velvet-roped supper club after the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, celebrating amongst a crowd that felt plucked from a Forbes rich list cover shoot.&nbsp;It was the kind of night that cemented a new chapter in his career &mdash; and what better place to toast to it than at the most exclusive table in town?</p><p>In a sport defined by speed, spectacle, and staggering displays of wealth, one party stands out as the hottest ticket on the Formula 1 calendar. Set on the sands of Miami Beach during the city&rsquo;s Grand Prix weekend, Carbone Beach has emerged as the crown jewel of the F1 social scene. Over the past four years, it <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/patrick-mahomes-carbone-beach-party-miami/10719549/" target="_self" rel="noopener">has attracted a guest list that includes Patrick Mahomes,</a> David Beckham, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Tom Brady - who&rsquo;ve all dined under the luxe canopy while watching performances by icons like Andrea Bocelli, Diana Ross, and Lauryn Hill.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Carbone is a New York dining institution. The spicy rigatoni has a cult following, and reservations are so hard to come by that the city&rsquo;s elite have been known to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/why-you-cant-get-a-restaurant-reservation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy tables on the underground market</a>&nbsp;for hundreds of dollars. So how did an intimate Italian joint in Manhattan&rsquo;s West Village become the epicenter of one of America&rsquo;s most exclusive events? The answer, according to Carbone Beach mastermind Marissa Brooks, is a &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; that coincided with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/culture/news/miami-grand-prix-2025-parties-events/10717990/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Formula 1&rsquo;s arrival in South Florida in 2022.</a></p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6zQGMMLY/s1000/travis-kelce-and-lando-norris-.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce and Lando Norris" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Travis Kelce and Lando Norris</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Carbone Beach</p><p>Major Food Group (MFG} - the hospitality company behind Carbone - had recently opened a Miami outpost of the restaurant. The problem? During the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, they didn&rsquo;t have nearly enough tables to meet demand. &ldquo;[MFG co-owner] Jeff Zalaznick called me six weeks out and said &lsquo;My restaurant&rsquo;s 100% booked, so I have this idea for a supper club in the sand,&rsquo;&rdquo; Brooks recalls. &ldquo;It was was fortuitous &hellip; because I also had an idea for a big event on the beach that would serve the high-end clientele that travels for Formula 1. He was like &lsquo;this is great, now make it look like Carbone.&rsquo; They were the new kid in town, and wanted to do something exciting and fresh - so we did.&rdquo;</p><p>The first edition of the four-night supper club, presented by American Express, came together in just six weeks, and Brooks was uniquely equipped for the challenge. After a decade with the Miami Heat, she joined the LVMH-owned watch brand, Hublot, and led their global F1 partnerships, which took her from yachts in Monaco to rooftops in Singapore. She had seen her fair share of F1 events and parties. &ldquo;The initial mood board was really about creating something magical. The idea was to bring together an incredible dining experience that nobody can provide like Major Food Group, coupled with all the bells and whistles of the extravagance [of F1],&rdquo; she went on. That meant chandeliers, ballerinas, a Ferrari F1 car, live entertainment, gold palm trees and a grand dining room inside a 50,000-square-foot tent designed to evoke Carbone&rsquo;s signature ambiance.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to keep people coming back to a place that feels familiar and feels like they're coming home. Mario [Carbone] has always talked about how his food is supposed to feel like family and friends. So instead of your table of eight, it's a table of 500,&rdquo; she says. While the experience has evolved each year, the structure is now well-established: guests arrive around sunset, sip cocktails over seafood towers and caviar, and then move into the dining room for a multi-course feast, capped off with a surprise performance. At $3,000 per head, you would expect nothing less.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RrQxpB0/s1000/carbone-beach.jpg" alt="Carbone Beach" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Carbone Beach</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Carbone Beach</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/254MEak0/s1000/james-corden-david-beckham-att.jpg" alt="James Corden and David Beckham " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">James Corden and David Beckham</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Omar Vega</p><p>If a celebrity is in town for the race, there&rsquo;s a high likelihood you&rsquo;ll find them at Carbone Beach. &ldquo;We always get the who's who. We're the destination at F1," Brooks explains. "The room is a mirror of what&rsquo;s going on in the market in business, entertainment, and sports. What I love is that I&rsquo;ve had people tell me, 'I can afford it, but I&rsquo;ve never had access like this.' There are no ropes between tables, so if LeBron James is there, and you bought a ticket and he bought a ticket - you&rsquo;re just in the room together,&rdquo; she says. Indeed, the guest list can feel surreal. Just days before the 2025 race, Carbone&rsquo;s Miami location hosted James, Elon Musk, Stephen Ross, and Kevin Durant - each a regular at Major Food Group venues.</p><p>"Last year, someone I&rsquo;ve known forever - an owner of a professional sports team - finally came for the first time. She looked at me and said, 'We had to come. This has become not just the biggest F1 party, but the &lsquo;it&rsquo; party in the country,&rsquo;&rdquo; Brooks recalls. Carbone Beach, she adds, now gets talked about in the same breath as the Vanity Fair Oscars party or the Met Gala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really humbling.&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0rGXM1G2/s1000/kygo-and-travis-kelce-at-ameri.jpg" alt="Kygo and Travis Kelce at American Express Presents Carbone Beach" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Kygo and Travis Kelce at American Express Presents Carbone Beach</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Omar Vega</p><p>Part of its allure is the nightly surprise performances, which remain under wraps until showtime. Acts have ranged from Ludacris and T-Pain to Pitbull and Jelly Roll. &ldquo;In the first year we opened with Andrea Bocelli, which was such a feat to get organized in six weeks,&rdquo; Brooks said, noting people in the audience were crying. &ldquo;Diana Ross was phenomenal in year two and getting Lauryn Hill in year three was amazing.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t buy a ticket expecting to see Taylor Swift or Beyonce. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t lean into the most expensive act, we lean into the entire experience,&rdquo; Brooks says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dropping zillions of dollars on bringing Bruce Springsteen. We&rsquo;re getting incredible performers who energize our guests and become part of the Carbone Beach story."</p><p>The success of the project has even led to expansion beyond Miami. "We launched Carbone Beach in Doha, so I lead that project as well with the Qatari Government," Brooks says. The event, which takes place during the Qatar Grand Prix, mirrors the Miami experience while adapting to the local market. &ldquo;[In Miami] it&rsquo;s all about being communal on the floor but in Doha we have these VIP boxes and we host the Prime Minister &hellip; you have to change the design to fit the audience,&rdquo; she explains.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gplnnm0/s1000/david-beckham-maverick-carter-.jpg" alt="David Beckham, Maverick Carter, James Corden, Lebron James " width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">David Beckham, Maverick Carter, James Corden, Lebron James</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Carbone Beach</p><p>Of course, producing a temporary venue for 500 people on a beach is a logistical feat in itself. &ldquo;You're always striving to make it perfect but when you have no power and no water &hellip; the logistics are so key to making us successful. From building air conditioning units to coordinating power and AV partners, to ensuring eight capacities [for the chandeliers] - it&rsquo;s a massive operation.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, Brooks knows exactly how to measure success. &ldquo;If every guest walks away with a &lsquo;wow&rsquo; moment &hellip; we&rsquo;ve done our job,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s phenomenal service, incredible food, the people they met, or maybe it&rsquo;s seeing Lando Norris or Travis Kelce - everyone&rsquo;s &lsquo;wow&rsquo; comes from a different place.&rdquo;</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/culture/news/lewis-hamilton-met-gala-symbolism-meaning-2025/10720344/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0rGXQby2/s2/gettyimages-2213049210.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">The hidden symbolism in Lewis Hamilton's Met Gala look</a><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1-academy/news/f1-academy-women-motorsport-netflix/10717791/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0rGXKKd2/s2/20250428-ed-ms-stateofwomensmo-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Everything you know about F1 Academy is wrong</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>At the Miami Grand Prix <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> denied <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> pole but only crossed the finish line in fourth in the race, nearly 40 seconds adrift of winner <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a> in the second <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>.</p><p>Fast-forward two weeks and Verstappen not only defeated both papaya drivers, but did so comfortably. If his Japanese Grand Prix win was largely down to retaining track position in a strategy-starved race, then the four-time world champion was good value for his win in Emilia Romagna, being pretty closely matched throughout the contest with much better tyre wear than anticipated.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/analysis-verstappen-impressive-overtake-piastri-imola-f1-gp/10724412/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0L1N41a2/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Analysis - The data behind Max Verstappen's impressive overtake on Oscar Piastri at Imola F1 GP</a><p>So, what happened? And was Imola's turnaround the result of Red Bull overperforming or McLaren missing the mark?</p><p>Both McLaren and Red Bull headed to the first race of the European season armed with modest upgrades, with McLaren adding downforce to the rear corner of the car and bringing a circuit-specific rear wing. Red Bull, too, optimised its rear corner aero as well as its sidepods, changes which compound the effect of a redesigned floor which Verstappen already ran in Miami.</p><p>As well as adding outright aerodynamic load, Imola's improvements appeared to have helped Red Bull keep its tyre temperatures under control, which was a limiting factor in races like Miami and Bahrain, where the team was also well beaten by McLaren. Ordinarily you would have expected Verstappen to start out strong but then start sliding and fading. Yet in Imola Piastri was the first to blink, pitting after just 14 laps.</p><p>"We've definitely managed to put some performance on the car and get it into a better window," Horner said. "And as soon as you take away the sliding, you're able to manage the temperature a lot better.</p><p>"The McLarens on Friday looked very, very fast on the long runs. But that's the first time I can remember in a long time we've had the pace to really pull away and out-deg the McLaren. So, that's very encouraging and a great result for the effort that's gone in behind the scenes."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2y3eLm96/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images</p><p>Horner also pointed out that Red Bull was "more surprised about McLaren's lack of performance", with his McLaren counterpart Andrea Stella mirroring those thoughts.</p><p>"I have to say we were a little surprised by the pace of Red Bull, which was very competitive," Stella acknowledged. "Well done to Max and Red Bull for being able to pull off this kind of performance, which meant that the race was very much decided by the swap of position between Oscar and Max in corner one. After that we tried to chase him, but effectively we didn't have enough race pace to be able to beat Max."</p><p>Stella pointed out that one major factor was Imola's traditional track layout, which featured more high-speed corners through which McLaren's MCL39 has met its match in the Red Bull RB21.</p><p>Qualifying GPS data showed Verstappen slightly ahead of Piastri down the fast left-handers of Rivazza and on the second half of most straights, with McLaren generally enjoying better traction and acceleration out of corners. The end result was a pole for Piastri by a mere 0.034s, with Mercedes' <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> just a tenth behind as well.</p><p>"If we look at the speed of the corners compared to Miami, it's a completely different regime," the Italian explained. "The car operates in a completely different part of the aerodynamic maps. We know that our car is strong on track layouts like Miami, Bahrain or China, but when it comes to high-speed corners like we have here in Imola, I don't think we enjoy any particular advantage. So the track layout, the progress of Red Bull, I think they are the two factors that meant that we didn't have much advantage."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qX5NX46/s1000/oscar-piastri-mclaren.jpg" alt="Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>One emerging trend has been McLaren's prowess in hot conditions, which helped it stand out with its superior rear tyre management on the aforementioned circuits. Quite why that advantage was absent in a warm Imola race - on Pirelli's softest tyre compounds too - is yet to be fully explained. "It's a good question. We will have to look at the data, we will have to look at the behaviour of the tyres and their thermal regime," Stella said.</p><p>Is it possible that Red Bull may have finally unlocked something with its upgrades and set-up work to keep its rear tyres under control?</p><p>"I'll tell you in a week," said Horner. "Generally, we're getting a better understanding, and the technical team have been working very hard on it. We genuinely thought it was going to be very tough to beat McLaren, so it was very reassuring that actually our degradation was better than theirs.</p><p>"I think we're starting to understand. The upgrades were mainly focused on characteristics rather than ultimate downforce. We've managed to address, hopefully subtly, some of the characteristics, which is encouraging for the upcoming races."</p><p>If those findings are confirmed in Monaco - where Red Bull struggled last year - and the high-downforce layout of Barcelona, perhaps the 2025 championship really won't be a McLaren walkover after all.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/jacques-villeneuve-accuses-mclaren-weak/10724474/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/6D1JDk40/s2/andrea-stella-team-principal-m.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Jacques Villeneuve accuses McLaren of being weak</a><p>But just like it would have been unproductive for Red Bull to panic after Bahrain or Miami, it also can't wheel away in jubilation either. Both teams will bring more upgrades to Barcelona in two weeks' time, when a stricter FIA directive on front wing flexing forces the grid to tweak its designs.</p><p>"No, I'm not confident anywhere," said Red Bull's tech chief Pierre Wache. "We were [competitive] in Japan and we were destroyed in Bahrain and Miami. Clearly, it's not [taken for] granted in this business. They develop and they have a very good car. Then we still have to push hard.</p><p>"I'm not sure it was a big improvement, but it was an improvement in the right direction."</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Penske cars penalized, sent to back of grid for Indy 500 ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Sunday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IndyCar officials saw something they didn't like on the rear attenuator of <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Newgarden</a>'s No. 2 Penske Chevrolet. Allegedly, the team filled in and smoothed out a part there that should not have been modified.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/will-power/4712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Will Power</a> passed pre-qualifying tech despite the modifications while Newgarden did not. The team had tried to fix the cars in the pit lane, hoping to still take part in Fast 12 qualifying. However, this was not allowed and the cars were ultimately pulled from the grid. Originally, Newgarden was set to start 11th and Power 12th, but some competitors believed this was unfair. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/pato-oward/837280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pato O'Ward</a> <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/pato-oward-penske-cars-should-have-been-sent-to-lcq-after-rules-breach/10724301/" target="_self" rel="noopener">claimed they likely ran outside the regulations in Saturday's qualifying session and should have been sent to the last-chance qualifier.</a></p><h2>Suspensions, fines, loss of starting position</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6zQGo9lY/s1000/will-power-team-penske.jpg" alt="Will Power, Team Penske" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Will Power, Team Penske</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>On Monday, IndyCar finally took action in a big way. Newgarden will start 32nd and Power 33rd as both cars have been sent to the very rear of the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The integrity of the Indianapolis 500 is paramount, and this violation of the IndyCar rule against modification to this part and using it &lsquo;as supplied&rsquo; is clear,&rdquo; IndyCar President J. Douglas Boles said. &ldquo;The penalty should be more than simply starting where the cars might have qualified anyway, if given the opportunity. The cars belong in the field as two of the fastest 33; however, starting on the tail of the field is the appropriate penalty in this instance.&rdquo;</p><p>IndyCar has also suspended the team strategists for both cars [Tim Cindric and Ron Ruzewski] and fined each entry $100,000. They will also forfeit their qualifying points. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/scott-mclaughlin/18844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott McLaughlin</a>, who crashed in Sunday morning practice, did not take part in Fast 12 qualifying.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/indycar-president-qualifying-scandal-devastating-roger-penske/10724537/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0rGX1Zq2/s2/indycar-president-doug-boles.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">IndyCar president says qualifying scandal is "devastating" to Roger Penske</a><p>IndyCar officials still inspected the No. 3 car and said, "Upon review of the car, and IndyCar impounding the No. 3 attenuator, IndyCar found that the car was in fact using a legal and unmodified attenuator."</p><p>Boles continued: &ldquo;The positive momentum around the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis 500 has been on a steep crescendo over the last several months, and we want it to be clear that our intent is to maintain that momentum and discourage teams from putting IndyCar in positions where it calls into the integrity of our officiating and the levelness of the playing field. As we look to the remainder of the week and the race this weekend, we will do everything we can to make it clear that this is not only the best racing on the planet but racing where the best win under completely fair conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>Team Penske has since released the following statement, fully accepting the penalties.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Team Penske statement in response to recent INDYCAR penalties: <a href="https://t.co/Mqgz0yuIlO">pic.twitter.com/Mqgz0yuIlO</a></p>&mdash; Team Penske (@Team_Penske) <a href="https://twitter.com/Team_Penske/status/1924519992348873067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2>Photos from Indianapolis 500 - Practice 8</h2><h3>Kyffin Simpson, Chip Ganassi Racing</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RrQpRV0/s8/kyffin-simpson-chip-ganassi-ra.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Penske Entertainment" /></p><p>Penske Entertainment</p><h3>Past Indy 500 winners: Will Power, Team Penske, Josef Newgarden, Team Penske, Scott Dixon, Chip Ganassi Racing, Takuma Sato, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, Alexander Rossi, Ed Carpenter Racing, Ryan Hunter-Reay, Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing, Helio Castroneve</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-3.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeB34z2/s8/past-indy-500-winners-will-pow.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Michael L.

Basically, they don't show the strength that Red Bull are always showing year after year.</p><p>"It's as if they're afraid to be aggressive in trying to win the drivers' championship, and they're afraid to go against Piastri.

He got caught out sleeping. He should never have come out of the corner second and then he didn't have the pace, which was odd. Norris had more pace.</p><p>"On the restart, McLaren knew that it was a matter of laps before Norris would have taken Piastri with the tyre difference, it was obvious.</p><p>"100 per cent sure he would get ahead, so why make him lose three laps instead of giving him a shot at Verstappen?&rdquo;</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/24vxqQP6/s1000/lando-norris-mclaren-oscar-pia.jpg" alt="Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Lando Norris, McLaren, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>The Dutchman&rsquo;s win sliced Piastri&rsquo;s lead in the championship to 22 points while Norris&rsquo;s second place is 13 points adrift of his team-mate.</p><p>Villeneuve says McLaren&rsquo;s failure to prioritise any driver is now playing into Verstappen&rsquo;s hands in the title race.</p><p>He added: "Because Verstappen is in for the championship. You don't want to give Verstappen wins. That's more points for him in the drivers' championship.</p><p>"They seem to be happy with second and third.

So why pit a little bit early? It's as if you're afraid to go for it.</p><p>"They didn't take advantage of the virtual safety car. At the end of the day, with the other safety car, it didn't make a difference. But still, it shows that lack of 'let's go for it&rsquo;."</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Alex Albon: “I was licking my lips” for Leclerc attack, ‘thought I could even get Piastri’ ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>After 2024's first seven rounds of the Formula 1 calendar, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/williams/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams</a> was one of two teams yet to score a point; <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine</a> had broken its duck in Miami, leaving just the British squad and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/sauber/9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sauber</a> as those yet to register a top 10.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/alex-albon/109625/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Albon</a> then got the team off the mark in Monaco with ninth, in a race spent tucked under Yuki Tsunoda's gearbox, as Williams continued to suffer the after-effects of building a FW46 that tipped the scales far beyond the minimum weight limit.</p><p>A year later, Albon has scored points in all but one of the seven grands prix so far, three of them amid the top five, as the Anglo-Thai racer has found excellent form with Williams' vastly improved 2025 package.</p><p>The metrics haven't entirely gone his own way; <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-2025-qualifying-imola-gp/10723577/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Albon trails new team-mate Carlos Sainz 3-4 in their qualifying head-to-heads (sprint qualifying not included)</a>, but Sainz has endured less luck in the races and has often come off worse with strategic calls. The Spaniard's short opening stint at Imola set him back in traffic, resulting in a battle to climb back into the points.</p><p>Albon, for his part, admitted he was slightly disappointed with fifth owing to his late-race pace; he reckoned that, had he been a little more circumspect in battling <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/109611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Leclerc</a> in the final stint, he might have even started to ratchet up the pressure on third-placed <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.</p><p>"It's weird, isn't it?" Albon mused to Sky Sports F1 after the Imola race. "On a pure race, we were fighting for P3, P4, but that's no safety car, that's just a pure situation.</p><p>"Maybe we were a little bit lucky with the VSC, admittedly, but at the same time, got unlucky again on the last safety car. We've got back-to-back P5s and coming away today a bit disappointed, which is a bit strange to say.</p><p>"I think maybe could have raced Charles a bit differently, could have done a bit better there, obviously lost out to Lewis, and then maybe could have been a bit more patient with my overtake to Charles.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gpl1rl0/s1000/charles-leclerc-ferrari-alexan.jpg" alt="Charles Leclerc, Ferrari, Alexander Albon, Williams" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Charles Leclerc, Ferrari, Alexander Albon, Williams</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>"I was kind of honestly licking my lips, I thought I could even get Oscar up in front as well, such was the pace and the new tyres we had on the car."</p><h2>Albon steps up as Williams continues to raise 2025 form</h2><p>The ex-Red Bull driver has found excellent form in the races this season, often proving to be quicker than Sainz over the long-run stints. Across his time at Williams, he's proven to be adept at pulling together strong tyre management races, which offers the team a bit more strategic latitude - remember Australia 2022, where he did all but the final lap on the same set of tyres to clinch 10th?</p><p>Now that Williams is in a position to challenge regularly amid the middle reaches of the points, Albon is finally getting the plaudits he deserves &ndash; having spent much of his post-Red Bull career honing his craft amid the lower midfield.</p><p>But, per his comments about Imola, Albon feels that there's more available; Williams might not have the top-end pace needed to stick the car in the top four on the grid, but its slow-burn race pace has put the FW47 in the equation &ndash; even with little development work over the year.</p><p>And that's reassuring, even if Albon has had to pinch himself slightly; he's admitted to being slightly dubious about whether the Grove squad's performance will last &ndash; and hadn't expected to be particularly strong at Imola.</p><p>"It's a weird one. Honestly, I keep telling myself it won't happen again, and it's this race, and then we go to the next race, and we're still very quick again, and it's a bit like, is it circumstantial, is it not?</p><p>"I would honestly say Miami and here, we've been quick. In my opinion, almost unexpectedly quick this weekend; I expected Miami to be good, but not here, and it kind of opens the window for what else.</p><p>"Maybe next week [at Monte Carlo] we're going to be good. I actually think Monaco won't be too bad, I think Barcelona we're going to struggle, but let's keep going, enjoying this while it lasts."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKE7vwr0/s1000/alex-albon-williams.jpg" alt="Alex Albon, Williams" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Alex Albon, Williams</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>Williams team principal James Vowles explained in a pre-Imola media session that the addition of Sainz was spurring Albon on to deliver his best &ndash; and that a genuinely collaborative relationship between the two has given both drivers a fresh perspective.</p><p>Explaining the team harmony, Vowles stated that although Albon had occasionally worried about the idea of Williams starting to favour Sainz, his non-political stance at the team has maintained that collaboration through the opening rounds.</p><p>"Alex, like any human being, needs to be pushed in order to get the absolute most out of them," Vowles said. "I don't know any elite athlete that is able to find the absolute limit by themselves, they need someone else to show them that a bit. So, first and foremost, that's it.</p><p>"We're now looking at the data, Alex is able to see two or three corners where Carlos is doing something slightly different, and they bounce off each other.</p><p>"Alex has no politics in him whatsoever at all, so it actually allows Carlos to be completely himself. He doesn't have to be worried about having a situation being thrown back against him.</p><p>"That's actually what caused part of the problem in Miami, he was worried that that was the circumstance and it's not whatsoever at all.</p><p>"With Alex, we've just got an individual who loves driving and racing cars fast and loves talking about it, and from the first meetings we had, Alex was telling everything to Carlos: 'Try this, do this, have a look at this, I did this in this corner and it'll help you get there.'</p><p>"That's not normal. Normally in teams, what you do is one of your drivers tries to hold that all back so you gain your advantage for a longer period of time."</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Ben Hunt</em></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Analysis - The data behind Max Verstappen's impressive overtake on Oscar Piastri at Imola F1 GP ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> laid the foundations for his fourth consecutive victory at Formula 1&rsquo;s Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in the first chicane.</p><p>Although the Red Bull driver suffered a relatively poor start, with even <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/george-russell/840489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Russell</a> momentarily passing him, Verstappen was first by the end of Turn 3 after a brilliant overtake on <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"At one point, I was in third on the straight. That wasn&rsquo;t ideal of course, but then I just braked a bit later than all the others!" Verstappen laughed when he looked back at his own overtake.</p><p>He outbraked Piastri heading into the Tamburello chicane to move around the outside of the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a>, squeezing his way past into a lead that Verstappen subsequently never lost.</p><p>So, what is the data behind it?</p><h2>Verstappen's car positioning: giving Norris and Russell no chance</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/24vxqvP6/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>It&rsquo;s easier said than done. Verstappen&rsquo;s move, in reality, was far more complex than his words suggest.</p><p>The world champion emphasised that it was crucial to stay on the racing line, which was grippier and less bumpy than the inside line. It was the first step in his successful attempt and, interestingly, mirrors another memorable Verstappen overtaking manoeuvre during a first lap: Mexico 2021.</p><p>Back then, Verstappen was on the outside as well, as he took advantage of the extra grip on the racing line, and managed to brake later than <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/valtteri-bottas/829609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valtteri Bottas</a> and, most crucially, his fierce title rival <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/829181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a>.</p><p>At Imola, Russell concluded post-race that Piastri had simply left the door open on the outside. It is true, but only tells one part of the story.</p><p>The other part is how Verstappen positioned his car, as the reigning world champion did it cleverly. After the slow start, he immediately looked both right and left in his mirrors to see where Russell and <a href="https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> were.</p><p>Verstappen positioned the car in such a way that Russell couldn&rsquo;t come across, ensuring that the <a href="https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a> driver could not block the outside line for the Dutchman. At the same time, he left just under a car&rsquo;s width of space on the right side of the track, preventing Norris from diving into that gap.</p><p>This way, Verstappen maintained control of his own racing line and kept the outside line &ndash; essentially the ideal racing line &ndash; entirely for himself, allowing him to initiate his late braking manoeuvre.</p><h2>The numbers align with Piastri&rsquo;s words: a 10-meter difference</h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0JB3KBN0/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Oscar Piastri, McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p><p>Regarding that late-braking move, the top speeds that Verstappen and Piastri reached at the end of the straight were nearly identical. The Red Bull driver hit 289 km/h during the acceleration phase after the start, while Piastri reached 288 km/h.</p><p>However, the <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> driver lifted off the throttle earlier than Verstappen. The data and telemetry show that Verstappen kept his right foot fully pressed to the floor for 10 metres longer than Piastri.</p><p>The championship leader also slowed down more gradually, as Piastri lifted off much earlier than his Red Bull rival, but Verstappen, after that, slammed on the brakes sooner.</p><p>As a result, Verstappen entered the braking zone nearly 30 km/h faster than Piastri. At the moment Verstappen began braking from his highest recorded speed (289 km/h), Piastri&rsquo;s speed was already at 260 km/h due to the earlier lift.</p><p>It&rsquo;s this nearly 30 km/h difference when entering the braking zone &ndash; seen in the image below, with Verstappen being the yellow line and Piastri the orange &ndash; that Verstappen was able to carry into the corner.</p><p>Or, as he put it: "When I braked late and then released the brake pedal, I thought 'okay, maybe this move is on'. So, I decided to carry that extra speed, and with that, you obviously get the momentum."</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2wBNowe0/s1000/max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-i.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen Oscar Piastri Imola Turn 1 Data" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen Oscar Piastri Imola Turn 1 Data</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Tracing Insights</p><p>Although Verstappen slowed down quicker due to his aggressive braking, the speed difference was still more than 15 km/h when he fully positioned his RB21 next to Piastri &ndash; 184 vs 168 km/h.</p><p>At the slowest point of the first chicane, the speed of the Red Bull driver was still slightly higher than Piastri&rsquo;s. Verstappen&rsquo;s speed at the slowest point of Tamburello was 140 km/h, while Piastri&rsquo;s was 136 km/h.</p><p>After that, both drivers accelerated more or less simultaneously, but Piastri had to do so in two phases. The Australian, according to telemetry, had to lift off a bit more than Verstappen again - logically because Verstappen had claimed the corner by then and was on what was originally the outside line, but later became the inside.</p><p>The numbers perfectly align with what Piastri himself explained afterwards. The McLaren driver took the first chicane in a fairly standard, cautious way by lifting off early - he thought it would do as he had the inside line covered.</p><p>When asked if he was surprised by Verstappen's move around the outside, Piastri replied in the post-race press conference: "Yeah. I thought I had it pretty under control, and it was a good move from Max. So, I&rsquo;ll learn for next time, clearly."</p><p>His response to the question about what he would do differently, also matches the data and telemetry: "Of course, I would do something different. I think I would brake about 10 metres later." This corresponds to the 10 metres he lifted off the throttle earlier and is exactly what led to the 30 km/h speed difference that Verstappen carried into the corner.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2d1kp3ZY/s1000/max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-i.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, Imola Turn 1 Telemetry" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, Imola Turn 1 Telemetry</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Tracing Insights</p><p>Together with the ideal racing line with more grip, mainly the result of how Verstappen positioned his car on the straight, gave him the momentum to complete what <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/how-max-verstappens-win-it-or-bin-it-move-won-red-bulls-400th-race-in-f1/10724236/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Horner has called "a win it or bin it move"</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s exactly what, combined with Red Bull's surprisingly good race pace, has earned Verstappen his second victory of the 2025 season. Or as the four-time world champion summed it up himself: "A move like this is never easy, but luckily, everything went well."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/max-verstappen-offended-as-fellow-drivers-question-nurburgring-record/10724016/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/27vdvZO0/s2/max-verstappen-emil-fray-racin.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Max Verstappen offended as fellow drivers question Nurburgring record</a> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Who is Albert Valera? The agent at the center of the MotoGP rider market ]]>
</title>
            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Following the news that <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/exclusive-jorge-martin-pushing-for-early-aprilia-exit/10722049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Martin intends to leave Aprilia at the end of the year</a>, Albert Valera, the Spaniard&rsquo;s agent, has become the name on everyone&rsquo;s lips in the MotoGP paddock. But who is the man holding the keys to shake up the MotoGP rider market?</p><p>At 40 years old, this native of the Maresme region&nbsp;&ndash; a coastal area north of Barcelona&nbsp;&ndash; looks after the interests of both <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jorge-martin/109340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/pedro-acosta/875418/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pedro Acosta</a>, another rising star likely to make headlines in the coming days. Acosta&rsquo;s future remains uncertain until KTM, his current team, resolves the financial puzzle it&rsquo;s entangled in.</p><p>Despite his current influence in the championship, Valera never intended to become a rider agent. His entrance into the role was purely accidental, brought about by a chance encounter with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jorge-lorenzo/4604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Lorenzo</a> just as Valera was planning to move to Australia.</p><p>The connection between them was Ricky Cardus, a mutual friend who now manages Rocco&rsquo;s Ranch, the motocross circuit next to Montmelo where much of the MotoGP grid trains. It was in 2012 when Lorenzo felt he needed a change in his professional circle.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a good relationship with Albert through Ricky. He always struck me as a sharp guy, and I was impressed by how well he expressed himself. At that time, I wanted to change my entourage. One day, I invited him to a restaurant in Barcelona and proposed that we start working together,&rdquo; Lorenzo told Motorsport.com.</p><p>Valera picks up the start of their partnership as his entry into the rider agent role.</p><p>&ldquo;I had never even considered representation. In fact, when Jorge brought it up, I was working at Johnson &amp; Johnson. I had just graduated with a degree in business administration and was planning to go abroad to study for an MBA. But then Jorge came along and everything changed,&rdquo; Valera said.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6n9ZmdmY/s1000/albert-valera-riders-and-footb.jpg" alt="Albert Valera speaks with Massimo Rivola, Aprilia Sports Director" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Albert Valera speaks with Massimo Rivola, Aprilia Sports Director</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Mirco Lazzari GP - Getty Images</p><p>Lorenzo was impressed instantly by Valera when he secured their first deal, which saw the Spaniard remain at Yamaha on a new two-year deal back in 2012.</p><p>&ldquo;Albert is a very intelligent and honest guy who&rsquo;s not driven by money. The first deal we signed worked well for both of us. His commission was lower than what other riders had agreed to pay their agents, but at that time, I was moving the biggest sums in the paddock,&rdquo; Lorenzo adds, recalling Valera&rsquo;s debut race as his representative. &ldquo;It was at Assen, and he already had to deal with Lin Jarvis there, in what turned out to be a pretty tense meeting.&rdquo;</p><p>Valera also helped negotiate Lorenzo&rsquo;s big-money deal with Ducati for the 2017 season, which earned the Mallorcan around &euro;25million over two years. By then, Valera&rsquo;s client list had already expanded to include <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/aleix-espargaro/14840/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aleix Espargaro</a> since 2013 and Jorge Martin since 2014.</p><p>This growth led to the expansion of Playmaker, the agency Valera founded to support his clients with full services. Beyond legal and financial experts, the agency also brought in communications specialists, such as Artur Vilalta &ndash; now Ducati&rsquo;s communications director&nbsp;&ndash; and Marc Balsells, Valera&rsquo;s current right-hand man.</p><p>Valera is now seen by some as the agent who pulls off the impossible. He managed to free Martin from KTM at the end of 2020 thanks to a clause he had included in the contract.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0oOzyBx0/s1000/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te.jpg" alt="Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Jorge Martin, Aprilia Racing Team</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Gold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images</p><p>A similar clause is now causing trouble for Aprilia.</p><p>Back then, the delayed start of the season due to COVID-19 allowed Martin to sign with Ducati and make his MotoGP debut with Pramac in 2021. As Motorsport.com revealed last week, a similar clause is in Martin&rsquo;s contract with Aprilia, but the manufacturer considers it invalid because the rider missed five of the first six races of the year.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, wounds like the one KTM suffered when Jorge left take time to heal,&rdquo; Valera said. &ldquo;But eventually, they do. As much as possible, I try to keep these matters from becoming personal. I understand why KTM was upset back then, and I also understand why the current situation is uncomfortable for Aprilia. But all I&rsquo;m doing is trying to create the best possible scenario for my riders.&rdquo;</p><p>In the coming weeks, he may face two high-stakes negotiations if Acosta also decides to leave KTM before his contract ends in order to join the VR46&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/ducati/538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ducati team</a>, which would welcome him with open arms.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/why-martin-vs-aprilia-conflict-will-have-no-easy-resolution/10722628/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/YKED7ab0/s2/jorge-martin-aprilia-racing-te-2.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Why Martin-vs-Aprilia conflict will have no easy resolution</a> ]]>

            <content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix featured two situations that initially looked similar but were handled differently by Formula 1&rsquo;s race control.</p><p>On lap 29, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/esteban-ocon/19624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esteban Ocon</a> suffered a technical issue on his Haas car and parked it on the grass between Turns 7 and 8.</p><p>Race control deployed the virtual safety car, which allows it to neutralise the race with drivers having to slow down, so that marshals could take the stricken car to a safe location. This process is shorter than a regular safety car and roughly maintains gaps between drivers.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/the-winners-and-losers-from-f1s-2025-imola-gp/10724245/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0mbBdqA2/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">The winners and losers from F1's 2025 Imola GP</a><p>In Ocon&rsquo;s case, marshals were able to intervene swiftly for two reasons. First, the Frenchman stopped close enough to an opening in the guardrail, making things easy. But most importantly, this was the first car to retire at this particular spot. In those conditions, it took some 3m40s to complete the VSC procedure.</p><p>Fast-forward to lap 46, and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/andrea-kimi-antonelli/953412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrea Kimi Antonelli</a> too was stricken by a mechanical problem on his <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a>. Like Ocon, the Italian rookie stopped on the grass, but closer to Turn 8. That time, race control opted for a regular safety car, which raised a few eyebrows.</p><p>Were they trying to revive a race that had been dominated by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> thus far?</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YMdwgvL2/s1000/safety-car.jpg" alt="Safety car" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Max Verstappen and Oliver Bearman behind the safety car</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Peter Fox / Getty Images</p><p>The reason why they proceeded this way is simple: one of the closest ways out of the circuit, for the car, was where Ocon&rsquo;s Haas was already stored, and there was no room for a second one.</p><p>Another option was located between Turns 8 and 9, but the track goes uphill in this particular section, so the use of a recovery vehicle was required to take the Mercedes there &ndash; which justified the safety car.</p><p>A safety car intervention takes longer than a VSC with several phases: the safety car coming on track, the field bunching up behind it, and once the track is clear, the possibility for backmarkers &ndash; in this case <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oliver-bearman/947083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oliver Bearman</a> &ndash; to overtake their way back into the lead lap.</p><p>As a consequence, between the moment when the safety car was deployed and the moment when the end of the procedure was announced, about 14 minutes &ndash; and eight laps &ndash; went by.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pato O'Ward: Penske cars should have been sent to LCQ after rules breach ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>After qualifying third for the this year's Indianapolis 500, Arrow McLaren's <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/pato-oward/837280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pato O'Ward</a> met with the media to discuss his strong showing. But when asked about the<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/all/news/penske-cars-fail-inspection-wont-be-allowed-to-make-run-at-indy-500-pole/10724256/" target="_self" rel="noopener"> technical violation involving Team Penske's two remaining cars in Fast 12 qualifying</a>, he did not hold back.</p><p>IndyCar officials found something amiss with the rear attenuator on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/josef-newgarden/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Newgarden</a>'s No. 2 Chevrolet. <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/will-power/4712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Will Power</a>'s No. 12 Chevrolet had the same issue, but was already sitting in the pit lane. Penske decided to work on the cars, believing they could rectify the problem and still qualify without issue, but that was not the case.</p><p>In the end, both cars were pulled out of line and took no further part in qualifying. They, along with <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/scott-mclaughlin/18844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott McLaughlin</a> <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/scott-mclaughlin-crash/10724205/" target="_self" rel="noopener">who crashed heavily in Sunday morning practice</a>, will share Row 4 (10th - 12th) on the grid. But O'Ward thinks the immediate punishment should have been far more severe.</p><h2><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/will-power-and-josef-newgarden-will-start-last-in-indy-500/10724487/" target="_self" rel="noopener"><strong>UPDATE: On Monday, IndyCar penalized the cars of Penske and Newgarden, sending both drivers to the rear of the field, suspending their race strategists and fining each entry $100,000.</strong></a></h2> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0qX5Mdw6/s1000/patricio-o-ward-arrow-mclaren.jpg" alt="Patricio O'ward, Arrow McLaren" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Patricio O'ward, Arrow McLaren</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Penske Entertainment</p><p>"They weren't accidentally doing it because they had the blowtorch right there in order to get it out," said O'Ward. "Honestly, I feel for [Jacob] Abel and for everybody that did the last chance qualifying. Those (Penske) cars weren't in regulations."</p><p>Rookie <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/jacob-abel/950543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Abel</a> <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/jacob-abel-indy-500-qualifying-fails-to-make-race-teammate-veekay/10724250/" target="_self" rel="noopener">was the lone driver who failed to qualify for the Indy 500</a>, losing out in the LCQ to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/rinus-veekay/831560/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rinus VeeKay</a>, <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/marcus-armstrong/444725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Armstrong</a>, and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/marco-andretti/2234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Andretti</a>. Meanwhile, all three Penske cars were fast enough for the Fast 12 via their efforts on Saturday.</p><p>"I'm not an engineer, so I can't tell you what they were doing, how much speed that it is or if it is any speed," continued O'Ward. "Obviously it's not in regulation. The rule is pretty black and white. Those cars should have been in the last chance qualifier. Like, those cars should have never -- obviously they didn't do anything in the Fast 12, but they should have been brought into the LCQ because they had that yesterday, I guarantee you. Until someone pointed it out today. Those cars, if they're disqualified today, they should have been disqualified yesterday.</p><p>"It's a shame really because they don't need to be doing that stuff. They're a great team. They have got great drivers. Why are doing that? It makes no sense."</p><h2>Photos from Indianapolis 500 - Practice 8</h2><h3>Kyffin Simpson, Chip Ganassi Racing</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0RrQpRV0/s8/kyffin-simpson-chip-ganassi-ra.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Penske Entertainment" /></p><p>Penske Entertainment</p><h3>Past Indy 500 winners: Will Power, Team Penske, Josef Newgarden, Team Penske, Scott Dixon, Chip Ganassi Racing, Takuma Sato, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, Alexander Rossi, Ed Carpenter Racing, Ryan Hunter-Reay, Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing, Helio Castroneve</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeB34z2/s8/past-indy-500-winners-will-pow.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Michael L.

<![CDATA[ <p>Red Bull boss Christian Horner has hinted that McLaren's position in both Formula 1 world championships, with two drivers in the mix, will likely lead to 'self-interest outweighing team interest' &ndash; which could hurt the Woking team.</p><p>Horner remarked on the two McLarens battling over second at the end of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, as <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lando-norris/289316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a> pitted under a late-race safety car which brought him out behind team-mate <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/828689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Piastri</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLaren</a> let the pair race rather than call for Piastri to move aside, which let <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> maintain his lead at the front of the field and disappear out of sight once more.</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/lando-norris-mclaren-had-no-answer-for-max-verstappens-speed-in-imola-gp/10724157/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/27vdqv30/s2/lando-norris-mclaren.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">Lando Norris admits McLaren had no answer for Max Verstappen&rsquo;s speed in Imola GP</a><p>Norris eventually dispatched his team-mate, but it was a close-run battle at Tamburello as Piastri defended the inside line into Turn 2; Horner praised both drivers for avoiding contact.</p><p>"Oscar had obviously pushed quite hard early on and you could see he was starting to get a little bit of graining on that front-right," Horner said of McLaren's race strategy.</p><p>"And so, it was borderline whether it was going to be a two-stop or one-stop. They obviously pulled the trigger on the two-stop, but it dropped you out because of the length of the pitlane here being 27 seconds.</p><p>"It put him into a world of pain traffic-wise. And so Max was then able to keep running and the deg was super low. And even with Lando in clean air behind, we were able to manage quite easily a nine-, nine-and-a-half-second gap.</p><p>"The VSC came out, and the pitstop was pretty straightforward. Oscar pitted again on his strategy, which sort of neutralised him, but by that time he'd used both of his hard tyres.</p> <img draggable="false" src="https://cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/63vbWegY/s1000/safety-car.jpg" alt="Safety car" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-portal-copyright="Motorsport.com" /> <p class="title">Safety car</p><p class="photographer">Photo by: Lars Baron / Motorsport Images via Getty Images</p><p>"And then that final safety car, obviously Max pitted, Lando pitted, but it dropped him behind Oscar, which was, you know, you've got two drivers that are fighting for a world championship.</p><p>"At some point, self-interest will always outweigh team interest. That's the conflict. So, they did a good job to not make contact. It was commendable that they were allowed to race, but you could see it got pretty close."</p><p>Horner believed that, on the day, Red Bull had the much stronger pace over the Imola race following the team's steady build-up through the weekend.</p><p>He was encouraged by the team's performance, particularly Verstappen's blend of competitive lap times and management on the tyres.</p><p>"I think today we had the pace to cover whatever they could throw at us," Horner added.</p><p>"I think the first stint was really encouraging because we could see that [Verstappen] was managing more than the guys behind. So, he was driving very smartly and still pulling out a gap.</p><p>"And that's always a happy place to be in. So, you get the longevity. And it's the first time in quite a while that we've been in that position."</p>Read Also:<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/the-winners-and-losers-from-f1s-2025-imola-gp/10724245/"><img src="//cdn.motorsport.com/images/amp/0mbBdqA2/s2/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-3.jpg" width="160" height="107" loading="lazy">The winners and losers from F1's 2025 Imola GP</a> ]]>
